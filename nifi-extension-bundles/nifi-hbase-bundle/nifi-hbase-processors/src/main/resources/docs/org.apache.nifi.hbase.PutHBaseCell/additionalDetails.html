<!-- Processor Documentation ================================================== -->
<h2>Visibility Labels</h2>
<p>
    This processor provides the ability to attach visibility labels to HBase Puts that it generates, if visibility labels
    are enabled on the HBase cluster. There are two ways to enable this:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Attributes on the flowfile.</li>
    <li>Dynamic properties added to the processor.</li>
</ul>
<p>When the dynamic properties are defined on the processor, they will be the default value, but can be overridden by
attributes set on the flowfile. The naming convention for both (property name and attribute name) is:</p>
<ul>
    <li>visibility.COLUMN_FAMILY - every column qualifier under the column family will get this.</li>
    <li>visibility.COLUMN_FAMILY.COLUMN_VISIBILITY - the qualified column qualifier will be assigned this value.</li>
</ul>
