    <description>
        This nifi-service-utils module is designed to capture common patterns
        and utilities that can be leveraged by other services or components to
        help promote reuse. These patterns may become framework level features
        or may simply be made available through this utility.  It is ok for this
        module to have dependencies but care should be taken when adding dependencies
        as this increases the cost of utilizing this module in various nars.
