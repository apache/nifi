# Ending Conditions

When you have completed a task, ensure that you have verified the following:

1. All code compiles and builds successfully using `mvn`.
2. All relevant unit tests pass successfully using `mvn`.
3. All code adheres to the Code Style rules.
4. Checkstyle and PMD pass successfully using
   `mvn checkstyle:check pmd:check -T 1C` from the appropriate directory.
5. Unit tests have been added to verify the functionality of any sufficiently complex method.
6. A system test or an integration test has been added if the change makes significant
   changes to the framework and the interaction between a significant number of classes.
7. You have performed a full review of the code to ensure that there are no logical errors
   and that the code is not duplicative or difficult to understand. If you find any code that
   is in need of refactoring due to clarity or duplication, you should report this to the user
   and offer to make those changes as well.
8. If creating a new Processor or Controller Service, ensure that all relevant annotations
   have been added, including `@Tags`, `@CapabilityDescription`, `@UseCase`, and
   `@MultiProcessorUseCase` as appropriate.


Do not consider the task complete until all of the above conditions have been met. When you
do consider the task complete, provide a summary of what you changed and which tests were
added or modified and what the behavior is that they verify. Additionally, provide any feedback
about your work that may need further review or that is not entirely complete.
