# Building

NiFi is a complex Maven codebase. Never build code (testing or otherwise) using javac.
Always use `mvn` instead, or preferably the `.mvnw` wrapper script.

Additionally, building a maven module using the also-make flag (`-am`) is often very
expensive and slow. Instead, only build the specific module you are modifying. Assume that
the user has already built the entire codebase and that only the specific module you are
modifying needs to be built again. If this fails, you can prompt the user to build the entire
codebase, but only after you have attempted to build the relevant modules yourself first.
It is important not to run `mvn clean` at the root level or at the `nifi-assembly` level without
the user's express permission, as this may delete a running instance of NiFi, causing permanent
loss of flows and configuration.
