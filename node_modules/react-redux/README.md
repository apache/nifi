## Installation

### Create a React Redux App

The recommended way to start new apps with React and Redux is by using [our official Redux+TS template for Vite](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-templates), or by creating a new Next.js project using [Next's `with-redux` template](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-redux).

Both of these already have Redux Toolkit and React-Redux configured appropriately for that build tool, and come with a small example app that demonstrates how to use several of Redux Toolkit's features.

```bash
# Vite with our Redux+TS template
# (using the `degit` tool to clone and extract the template)
npx degit reduxjs/redux-templates/packages/vite-template-redux my-app

# Next.js using the `with-redux` template
npx create-next-app --example with-redux my-app
```

### An Existing React App

React Redux 8.0 requires **React 16.8.3 or later** (or React Native 0.59 or later).

To use React Redux with your React app, install it as a dependency:

```bash
# If you use npm:
npm install react-redux

# Or if you use Yarn:
yarn add react-redux
```

You'll also need to [install Redux](https://redux.js.org/introduction/installation) and [set up a Redux store](https://redux.js.org/recipes/configuring-your-store/) in your app.

This assumes that you’re using [npm](http://npmjs.com/) package manager
with a module bundler like [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) or
[Browserify](http://browserify.org/) to consume [CommonJS
modules](https://webpack.js.org/api/module-methods/#commonjs).

If you don’t yet use [npm](http://npmjs.com/) or a modern module bundler, and would rather prefer a single-file [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) build that makes `ReactRedux` available as a global object, you can grab a pre-built version from [cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/react-redux). We _don’t_ recommend this approach for any serious application, as most of the libraries complementary to Redux are only available on [npm](http://npmjs.com/).

## Documentation

The React Redux docs are published at **https://react-redux.js.org** .

## How Does It Work?

The post [The History and Implementation of React-Redux](https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2018/11/react-redux-history-implementation/)
explains what it does, how it works, and how the API and implementation have evolved over time.

There's also a [Deep Dive into React-Redux](https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2019/06/presentation-react-redux-deep-dive/) talk that covers some of the same material at a higher level.
