<h2>Data Model</h2>
<p>
    This processor executes an Apache Flume sink. FlowFiles are wrapped in Flume's
    Event interface. The content of the FlowFile becomes the body of the Event and
    the attributes of the FlowFile become Event headers. The following special
    headers are also set:
</p>
<table id="headers">
    <tr>
        <th>Flume Event Header</th>
        <th>FlowFile Attribute</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>nifi.entry.date</td>
        <td>FlowFile#getEntryDate()</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>nifi.id</td>
        <td>FlowFile#getId()</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>nifi.last.queue.date</td>
        <td>FlowFile#getLastQueueDate()</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>nifi.lineage.identifiers.${i}</td>
        <td>FlowFile#getLineageIdentifiers()[i]</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>nifi.lineage.start.date</td>
        <td>FlowFile#getLineageStartDate()</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>nifi.size</td>
        <td>FlowFile#getSize()</td>
    </tr>
</table>
<h2>Warning</h2>
<p>
    In NiFi, the contents of a FlowFile are accessed via a stream, but in Flume it is
    stored in a byte array. This means the full content will be loaded into memory when
    a FlowFile is processed by the ExecuteFlumeSink processor. You should consider the
    typical size of the FlowFiles you'll process and the batch size, if any, your sink
    is configured with when setting NiFi's heap size.
</p>
<h2>Configuration Details</h2>
<p>
    This processor is designed to execute arbitrary Flume sinks. Most of the details
    of configuring the sink is deferred to Flume's built-in configuration system.
    For details on the available settings for each sink type, refer to the Flume
    <a href="http://flume.apache.org/FlumeUserGuide.html#flume-sinks">User Guide</a>.
    Configuring the Flume sink is a four step process:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Set the Sink Type property to a valid Flume sink type.</li>
    <li>
        Set the Agent Name property to the name of the agent in your
        Flume configuration. This is the prefix of the properties in the Flume
        configuration file. Example: <code>tier1</code>
    </li>
    <li>
        Set the Sink Name property to the name of the sink in your Flume
        configuration. If Agent Name is <code>tier1</code>, then the Sink Name
        is the value of the <code>tier1.sinks</code> property. Example: <code>sink-1</code>
    </li>
    <li>
        Copy and paste the configuration for the sink from your Flume configuration
        file into the Flume Configuration property. Assuming you're using
        the same Agent Name and Sink Name as in the examples above, this will be all
        of the properties that start with <code>tier1.sinks.sink-1</code>.
        Do not copy the <code>tier1.sinks.sink-1.type</code> or
        <code>tier1.sinks.sink-1.channel</code> properties.
    </li>
</ol>
<h2>Usage Example</h2>
<p>
    Assuming you had the following existing Flume configuration file:
</p>
    <pre>
a1.sources = r1
a1.sinks = k1
a1.channels = c1

a1.sources.r1.type = netcat
a1.sources.r1.bind = localhost
a1.sources.r1.port = 44444

a1.sinks.k1.type = hdfs
a1.sinks.k1.channel = c1
a1.sinks.k1.hdfs.path = /flume/events/%y-%m-%d/%H%M/%S
a1.sinks.k1.hdfs.filePrefix = events-
a1.sinks.k1.hdfs.round = true
a1.sinks.k1.hdfs.roundValue = 10
a1.sinks.k1.hdfs.roundUnit = minute

a1.channels.c1.type = memory
a1.channels.c1.capacity = 1000
a1.channels.c1.transactionCapacity = 100

a1.sources.r1.channels = c1
a1.sinks.k1.channel = c1</pre>
<p>
    Then you'd configure the ExecuteFlumeSink as follows:
</p>
<table id="example">
    <tr>
        <th>Property</th>
        <th>Value</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Sink Type</td>
        <td>hdfs</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Agent Name</td>
        <td>a1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Sink Name</td>
        <td>k1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Flume Configuration</td>
        <td>
            <code>
                a1.sinks.k1.hdfs.path = /flume/events/%y-%m-%d/%H%M/%S<br>
                a1.sinks.k1.hdfs.filePrefix = events-<br>
                a1.sinks.k1.hdfs.round = true<br>
                a1.sinks.k1.hdfs.roundValue = 10<br>
                a1.sinks.k1.hdfs.roundUnit = minute
            </code>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>
