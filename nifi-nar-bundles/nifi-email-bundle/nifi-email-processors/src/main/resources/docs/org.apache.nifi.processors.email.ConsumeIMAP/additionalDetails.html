	<!-- Processor Documentation ================================================== -->
	<h2>Description:</h2>
	<p>This Processor consumes email messages via IMAP protocol and sends the content of an email message as content of the Flow File. 
	   Content of the incoming email message is written as raw bytes to the content of the outgoing Flow File.
    </p>

	<p>Different email providers may require additional Java Mail properties which could be provided as dynamic properties.
       For example, below is a sample configuration for GMail:

	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Processor's static properties:</b>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Host Name</b> - imap.gmail.com</li>
			<li><b>Port</b> - 993</li>
			<li><b>User Name</b> - <i>[your user name]</i></li>
			<li><b>Password</b> - <i>[your password]</i></li>
			<li><b>Folder</b> - INBOX</li>
		</ul>
		<b>Processor's dynamic properties:</b>
		<ul>
			<li><b>mail.imap.socketFactory.class</b> - javax.net.ssl.SSLSocketFactory</li>
			<li><b>mail.imap.socketFactory.fallback</b> - false</li>
			<li><b>mail.store.protocol</b> - imaps</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
	Another useful property is <b>mail.debug</b> which allows Java Mail API to print protocol messages to the console helping you to both understand what's going on as well as debug issues.
	</p>
	<p>
	For the full list of available Java Mail properties please refer to <a href="http://connector.sourceforge.net/doc-files/Properties.html">here</a>
