<h2>Description:</h2>

<p>
    PutInfluxDBRecord processor uses a specified RecordReader to write the content of a FlowFile into InfluxDB database.
</p>

<h3>Mapping Records to InfluxDB Data Point</h3>

<h4>Measurement</h4>
<p>
    The value is determined from the field in the Record Schema.
    If the field is not found in the schema then is used the value of <i>Measurement property</i>.
    Any data type is converted into a String type and used as the value.
</p>

<h4>Tags</h4>
<p>
    The name of the field in the Record Schema is used as the key of the Tag. The value of the field is used as the value of the
    Tag. Any data type is converted into a String type and used as the Tag value
    (see also <a href="#handling_complex">handling complex types</a>).
</p>

<h4>Fields</h4>
<p>
    The name of the field in the Record Schema is used as the key of the Tag. The value of the field is used as the value of the
    Tag. The Record Field data type is converted into a <a
        href="https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/latest/write_protocols/line_protocol_tutorial/#data-types">supported
    InfluxDB types</a>:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>DOUBLE, FLOAT - is converted into InfluxDB Floats</li>
    <li>LONG, INT, BYTE, SHORT, BIGINT - is converted into InfluxDB Integers</li>
    <li>BOOLEAN - is converted into InfluxDB Booleans</li>
    <li>CHAR, STRING - is converted into InfluxDB Strings</li>
    <li>DATE, TIME, TIMESTAMP - is converted into InfluxDB Integers</li>
    <li>CHOICE, MAP, ARRAY, RECORD - <a href="#handling_complex">handling complex types</a></li>
</ul>

<h4>Timestamp</h4>
<p>
    The value is determined from the field in the Record Schema.
    If the field is not found in the schema or field has not defined value the timestamp is not specified for the Data Point.
    The precision for the supplied time value is determined from the property <i>Timestamp precision</i>.
</p>

<h3 id="handling_complex">Behavior of handling complex types for Tags and Fields</h3>

<p>
    The Apache NiFi complex Record fields are handled by different strategy:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Map</strong> - keys are mapped as keys of Tags or Fields, values are mapped as values of Tags or Fields
    </li>
    <li><strong>Choice</strong> - for the value is used the compatible type from Choice definition</li>
    <li><strong>Array</strong> - based on property the <i>Complex Field Behavior</i></li>
    <li><strong>Record</strong> - based on property the <i>Complex Field Behavior</i></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="batching">Batching</h3>

<p>
    Enabled batching will reduce reliability in the cost of
    better performance. The PutInfluxDBRecord processor uses batching/buffering implemented in influxdb-java client.
    Processor can route flow file to the success relation before the batch buffer is flushed into the database. The
    batch buffer is stored in the system memory, so in the case of power failure or process kill, is content of buffer
    not written into InfluxDB.
</p>
<p>
    Batching is useful when the flow file contains large number of records. Records are sent
    into InfluxDB in batching points with preconfigured size.
