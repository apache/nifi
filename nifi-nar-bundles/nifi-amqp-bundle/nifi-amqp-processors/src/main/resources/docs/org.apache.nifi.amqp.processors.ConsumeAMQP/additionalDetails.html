<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
    This processor consumes messages from AMQP messaging queue and converts them to a FlowFile to be routed to the next component in the flow.
    At the time of writing this document the supported AMQP protocol version is v0.9.1.
</p>
<p>
	The component is based on <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/api-guide.html">RabbitMQ Client API</a>
	<a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/getstarted.html">The following guide and tutorial</a> may also help you to brush up on some of the AMQP basics.
</p>
<p>
    This processor does two things. It constructs FlwFile by extracting information from the consumed AMQP message (both body and attributes). 
    Once message is consumed a FlowFile is constructed. The message body is written to a FlowFile and its <i>com.rabbitmq.client.AMQP.BasicProperties</i>
    are transfered into the FlowFile as attributes. AMQP attribute names are prefixed with <i>amqp$</i> prefix.
</p>
<h2>AMQP Properties</h2>
<p>
    The following is the list of available standard AMQP properties which may come with the message: <i>("amqp$contentType", "amqp$contentEncoding",
            "amqp$headers", "amqp$deliveryMode", "amqp$priority", "amqp$correlationId", "amqp$replyTo",
            "amqp$expiration", "amqp$messageId", "amqp$timestamp", "amqp$type", "amqp$userId", "amqp$appId",
            "amqp$clusterId")</i>
</p>
<h2>Configuration Details</h2>
<p>
    At the time of writing this document it only defines the essential configuration properties which are suitable for most cases. 
    Other properties will be defined later as this component progresses.
