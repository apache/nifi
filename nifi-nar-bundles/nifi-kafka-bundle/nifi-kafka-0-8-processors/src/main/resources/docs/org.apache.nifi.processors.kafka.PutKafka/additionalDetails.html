        <!-- Processor Documentation ================================================== -->
        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>
            This Processors puts the contents of a FlowFile to a Topic in 
            <a href="http://kafka.apache.org/">Apache Kafka</a>. The full contents of
            a FlowFile becomes the contents of a single message in Kafka.
            This message is optionally assigned a key by using the
            &lt;Kafka Key&gt; Property.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Processor allows the user to configure an optional Message Delimiter that
            can be used to send many messages per FlowFile. For example, a \n could be used
            to indicate that the contents of the FlowFile should be used to send one message
            per line of text. If the property is not set, the entire contents of the FlowFile
            will be sent as a single message. When using the delimiter, if some messages are
            successfully sent but other messages fail to send, the FlowFile will be FORKed into
            two child FlowFiles, with the successfully sent messages being routed to 'success'
            and the messages that could not be sent going to 'failure'.
