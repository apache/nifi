        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>
            This Processor polls <a href="http://kafka.apache.org/">Apache Kafka</a>
            for data using KafkaConsumer API available with Kafka 0.9.x. When a message is received 
            from Kafka, this Processor emits a FlowFile where the content of the FlowFile is the value 
            of the Kafka message.
