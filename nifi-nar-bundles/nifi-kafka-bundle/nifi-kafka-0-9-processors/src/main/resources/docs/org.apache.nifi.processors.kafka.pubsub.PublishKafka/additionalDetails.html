        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>
            This Processor puts the contents of a FlowFile to a Topic in
            <a href="http://kafka.apache.org/">Apache Kafka</a> using KafkaProducer API available
            with Kafka 0.9.x API. The content of a FlowFile becomes the contents of a Kafka message.
            This message is optionally assigned a key by using the &lt;Kafka Key&gt; Property.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Processor allows the user to configure an optional Message Demarcator that
            can be used to send many messages per FlowFile. For example, a <i>\n</i> could be used
            to indicate that the contents of the FlowFile should be used to send one message
            per line of text. It also supports multi-char demarcators (e.g., 'my custom demarcator').
            If the property is not set, the entire contents of the FlowFile
            will be sent as a single message. When using the demarcator, if some messages are
            successfully sent but other messages fail to send, the resulting FlowFile will be
            considered a failed FlowFile and will have additional attributes to that effect.
            One of such attributes is 'failed.last.idx' which indicates the index of the last message
            that was successfully ACKed by Kafka. (if no demarcator is used the value of this index will be -1).
            This will allow PublishKafka to only re-send un-ACKed messages on the next re-try.
