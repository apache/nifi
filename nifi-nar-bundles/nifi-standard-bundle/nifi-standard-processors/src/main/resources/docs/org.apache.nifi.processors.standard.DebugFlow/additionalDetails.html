        <!-- Processor Documentation ================================================== -->
        <p>
            When triggered, the processor loops through the appropriate response list (based on whether or not it
            received a FlowFile).  A response is produced the configured number of times for each pass through its
            response list, as long as the processor is running.
        </p><p>
            Triggered by a FlowFile, the processor can produce the following responses.
            <ol>
                <li>transfer FlowFile to success relationship.</li>
                <li>transfer FlowFile to failure relationship.</li>
                <li>rollback the FlowFile without penalty.</li>
                <li>rollback the FlowFile and yield the context.</li>
                <li>rollback the FlowFile with penalty.</li>
                <li>throw an exception.</li>
            </ol>
        </p><p>
            Triggered without a FlowFile, the processor can produce the following responses.
            <ol>
                <li>do nothing and return.</li>
                <li>throw an exception.</li>
                <li>yield the context.</li>
            </ol>
