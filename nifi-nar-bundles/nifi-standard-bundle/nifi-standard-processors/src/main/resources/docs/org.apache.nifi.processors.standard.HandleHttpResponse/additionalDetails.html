        <h2>Usage Description:</h2>
        <p>
            The pairing of this Processor with a <a href="../org.apache.nifi.processors.standard.HandleHttpRequest/index.html">HandleHttpRequest</a> Processor
            provides the ability to use NiFi to visually construct a web server that can carry out any functionality that is available
            through the existing Processors. For example, one could construct a Web-based front end to an SFTP Server by constructing a
            flow such as:
        </p>

        <p>
            <a href="../org.apache.nifi.processors.standard.HandleHttpRequest/index.html">HandleHttpRequest</a> -> 
            <a href="../org.apache.nifi.processors.standard.PutSFTP/index.html">PutSFTP</a> ->
            <a href="index.html">HandleHttpResponse</a>
        </p>

        <p>
            This Processor must be configured with the same &lt;HTTP Context Map&gt; service as the corresponding HandleHttpRequest Processor.
            Otherwise, all FlowFiles will be routed to the 'failure' relationship.
        </p>
