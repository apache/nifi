        <h2>Description:</h2>

        <p>
            Reporting Task that creates a log message for each Processor and each Connection in the flow.

            For Processors, the following information is included (sorted by descending Processing Timing):
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Processor Name</li>
            <li>Processor ID</li>
            <li>Processor Type</li>
            <li>Run Status</li>
            <li>Flow Files In (5 mins)</li>
            <li>FlowFiles Out (5 mins)</li>
            <li>Bytes Read from Disk (5 mins)</li>
            <li>Bytes Written to Disk (5 mins)</li>
            <li>Number of Tasks Completed (5 mins)</li>
            <li>Processing Time (5 mins)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            For Connections, the following information is included (sorted by descending size of queued FlowFiles):
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Connection Name</li>
            <li>Connection ID</li>
            <li>Source Component Name</li>
            <li>Destination Component Name</li>
            <li>Flow Files In (5 mins)</li>
            <li>FlowFiles Out (5 mins)</li>
            <li>FlowFiles Queued</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            If may be convenient to redirect the logging output of this ReportingTask to a separate log file than the typical application log.
            This can be accomplished by modified the logback.xml file in the NiFi conf/ directory such that a logger with the name
            <code>org.apache.nifi.controller.ControllerStatusReportingTask</code> is configured to write to a separate log.
        </p>

        <p>
            Additionally, it may be convenient to disable logging for Processors or for Connections or to split them into separate log files. This
            can be accomplished by using the loggers named 
            <code>org.apache.nifi.controller.ControllerStatusReportingTask.Processors</code> and 
            <code>org.apache.nifi.controller.ControllerStatusReportingTask.Connections</code>, respectively.
