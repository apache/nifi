<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
    This processor polls a SNMP agent to get information for a given OID (Strategy = GET) or for all the sub-tree
    associated to a given OID
    (Strategy = WALK). This processors supports SNMPv1, SNMPv2c and SNMPv3. The component is based on <a
        href="http://www.snmp4j.org/">SNMP4J</a>.
</p>
<p>
    When the processor is triggered, it sends the SNMP request and gets the information associated to request OID(s).
    Once response is received
    from the SNMP agent, a FlowFile is constructed. The FlowFile content is empty, all the information is written in the
    FlowFile attributes.
    In case of a single GET request, the properties associated to the received PDU are transferred into the FlowFile as
    attributes. In case of a
    WALK request, only the couples "OID/value" are transferred into the FlowFile as attributes. SNMP attributes names
    are prefixed with
    <i>snmp$</i> prefix.
</p>
<p>
    Regarding the attributes representing the couples "OID/value", the attribute name has the following format:
<ul>
    <li>snmp$<i>OID</i>$<i>SMI_Syntax_Value</i></li>
</ul>
where OID is the request OID, and SMI_Syntax_Value is the integer representing the type of the value associated to the
OID. This value is
provided to allow the SetSNMP processor setting values in the correct type.
</p>
<h2>SNMP Properties</h2>
<p>
    In case of a single SNMP Get request, the following is the list of available standard SNMP properties which may come
    with the PDU:
    <i>("snmp$errorIndex", "snmp$errorStatus", "snmp$errorStatusText", "snmp$nonRepeaters", "snmp$requestID",
        "snmp$type")</i>
