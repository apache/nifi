<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
    This processor publishes the contents of the incoming FlowFile to a JMS compliant messaging system.
</p>
<p>
    This processor does two things. It constructs JMS Message by extracting FlowFile contents (both body and attributes). 
    Once message is constructed it is sent to a pre-configured JMS Destination.
    Standard <a href="http://docs.spring.io/spring-integration/api/org/springframework/integration/jms/JmsHeaders.html">JMS Headers</a> 
    will be extracted from the FlowFile and set on <i>javax.jms.Message</i> as JMS headers while other 
    FlowFile attributes will be set as properties of <i>javax.jms.Message</i>. Upon success the incoming FlowFile is transferred
    to the <i>success</i> Relationship and upon failure FlowFile is
    penalized and transferred to the <i>failure</i> Relationship.
</p>
