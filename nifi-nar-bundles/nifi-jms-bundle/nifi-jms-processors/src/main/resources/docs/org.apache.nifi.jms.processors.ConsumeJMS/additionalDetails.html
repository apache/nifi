<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
    This processor consumes messages from JMS compliant messaging system and converts them to a FlowFile to be routed to the next component in the flow.
</p>
<p>
    This processor does two things. It constructs FlowFile by extracting information from the consumed JMS message including body, standard 
    <a href="http://docs.spring.io/spring-integration/api/org/springframework/integration/jms/JmsHeaders.html">JMS Headers</a> and Properties. 
    The message body is written to a FlowFile while standard JMS Headers and Properties are set as FlowFile attributes.
</p>

<h2>Configuration Details</h2>

    At the time of writing this document it only defines the essential configuration properties which are suitable for most cases. 
    Other properties will be defined later as this component progresses.
