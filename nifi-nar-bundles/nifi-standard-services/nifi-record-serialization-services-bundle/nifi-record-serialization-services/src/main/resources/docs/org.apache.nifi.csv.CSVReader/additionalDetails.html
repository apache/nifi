        <p>
        	The CSVReader Controller Service, expects input in such a way that the first line of a FlowFile specifies the name of
        	each column in the data. Following the first line, the rest of the FlowFile is expected to be valid CSV data from which
        	to form appropriate Records. The reader allows for customization of the CSV Format, such as which character should be used
        	to separate CSV fields, which character should be used for quoting and when to quote fields, which character should denote
        	a comment, etc.
        </p>


		<h2>Schemas and Type Coercion</h2>
		
		<p>
			When a record is parsed from incoming data, it is separated into fields. Each of these fields is then looked up against the
			configured schema (by field name) in order to determine what the type of the data should be. If the field is not present in
			the schema, that field is omitted from the Record. If the field is found in the schema, the data type of the received data
			is compared against the data type specified in the schema. If the types match, the value of that field is used as-is. If the
			schema indicates that the field should be of a different type, then the Controller Service will attempt to coerce the data
			into the type specified by the schema. If the field cannot be coerced into the specified type, an Exception will be thrown.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			The following rules apply when attempting to coerce a field value from one data type to another:
		</p>
			
		<ul>
			<li>Any data type can be coerced into a String type.</li>
			<li>Any numeric data type (Byte, Short, Int, Long, Float, Double) can be coerced into any other numeric data type.</li>
			<li>Any numeric value can be coerced into a Date, Time, or Timestamp type, by assuming that the Long value is the number of
			milliseconds since epoch (Midnight GMT, January 1, 1970).</li>
			<li>A String value can be coerced into a Date, Time, or Timestamp type, if its format matches the configured "Date Format," "Time Format,"
				or "Timestamp Format."</li>
			<li>A String value can be coerced into a numeric value if the value is of the appropriate type. For example, the String value
				<code>8</code> can be coerced into any numeric type. However, the String value <code>8.2</code> can be coerced into a Double or Float
				type but not an Integer.</li>
			<li>A String value of "true" or "false" (regardless of case) can be coerced into a Boolean value.</li>
			<li>A String value that is not empty can be coerced into a Char type. If the String contains more than 1 character, the first character is used
				and the rest of the characters are ignored.</li>
			<li>Any "date/time" type (Date, Time, Timestamp) can be coerced into any other "date/time" type.</li>
			<li>Any "date/time" type can be coerced into a Long type, representing the number of milliseconds since epoch (Midnight GMT, January 1, 1970).</li>
			<li>Any "date/time" type can be coerced into a String. The format of the String is whatever DateFormat is configured for the corresponding
				property (Date Format, Time Format, Timestamp Format property).</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>
			If none of the above rules apply when attempting to coerce a value from one data type to another, the coercion will fail and an Exception
			will be thrown.

		<h2>Examples</h2>
		
        <p>
        	As an example, consider a FlowFile whose contents consists of the following:
        </p>

        <code>
        	id, name, balance, join_date, notes<br />
        	1, John, 48.23, 04/03/2007 "Our very<br />
first customer!"<br />
        	2, Jane, 1245.89, 08/22/2009,<br />
        	3, Frank Franklin, "48481.29", 04/04/2016,<br />
        </code>
        
        <p>
        	Additionally, let's consider that this Controller Service is configured with the Schema Registry pointing to an AvroSchemaRegistry and the schema is
        	configured as the following:
        </p>
        
		<code>
		<pre>
		{
		  "namespace": "nifi",
		  "name": "balances",
		  "type": "record",
		  "fields": [
		  		{ "name": "id", "type": "int" },
		  		{ "name": "name": "type": "string" },
		  		{ "name": "balance": "type": "double" },
		  		{ "name": "join_date", "type": {
		  			"type": "int",
		  			"logicalType": "date"
		  		},
		  		{ "name": "notes": "type": "string" }
		  ]
		}
		</pre>
		</code>

    	<p>
    		In the example above, we see that the 'join_date' column is a Date type. In order for the CSV Reader to be able to properly parse a value as a date,
    		we need to provide the reader with the date format to use. In this example, we would configure the Date Format property to be <code>MM/dd/yyyy</code>
    		to indicate that it is a two-digit month, followed by a two-digit day, followed by a four-digit year - each separated by a slash.
    		In this case, the result will be that this FlowFile consists of 3 different records. The first record will contain the following values:
    	</p>

		<table>
    		<head>
    			<th>Field Name</th>
    			<th>Field Value</th>
    		</head>
    		<body>
    			<tr>
    				<td>id</td>
    				<td>1</td>
    			</tr>
    			<tr>
    				<td>name</td>
    				<td>John</td>
    			</tr>
    			<tr>
    				<td>balance</td>
    				<td>48.23</td>
    			</tr>
    			<tr>
    				<td>join_date</td>
    				<td>04/03/2007</td>
    			</tr>
    			<tr>
    				<td>notes</td>
    				<td>Our very<br />first customer!</td>
    			</tr>
    		</body>
    	</table>
    	
    	<p>
    		The second record will contain the following values:
    	</p>
    	
		<table>
    		<head>
    			<th>Field Name</th>
    			<th>Field Value</th>
    		</head>
    		<body>
    			<tr>
    				<td>id</td>
    				<td>2</td>
    			</tr>
    			<tr>
    				<td>name</td>
    				<td>Jane</td>
    			</tr>
    			<tr>
    				<td>balance</td>
    				<td>1245.89</td>
    			</tr>
    			<tr>
    				<td>join_date</td>
    				<td>08/22/2009</td>
    			</tr>
    			<tr>
    				<td>notes</td>
    				<td></td>
    			</tr>
    		</body>
    	</table>
    	
		<p>
			The third record will contain the following values:
		</p>    	
    	
		<table>
    		<head>
    			<th>Field Name</th>
    			<th>Field Value</th>
    		</head>
    		<body>
    			<tr>
    				<td>id</td>
    				<td>3</td>
    			</tr>
    			<tr>
    				<td>name</td>
    				<td>Frank Franklin</td>
    			</tr>
    			<tr>
    				<td>balance</td>
    				<td>48481.29</td>
    			</tr>
    			<tr>
    				<td>join_date</td>
    				<td>04/04/2016</td>
    			</tr>
    			<tr>
    				<td>notes</td>
    				<td></td>
    			</tr>
    		</body>
    	</table>
    	
    	
    </body>
