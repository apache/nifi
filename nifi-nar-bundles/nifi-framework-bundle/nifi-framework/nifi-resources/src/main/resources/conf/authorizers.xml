    This file lists the userGroupProviders, accessPolicyProviders, and authorizers to use when running securely. In order
    to use a specific authorizer it must be configured here and it's identifier must be specified in the nifi.properties file.
    If the authorizer is a managedAuthorizer, it may need to be configured with an accessPolicyProvider and an userGroupProvider.
    This file allows for configuration of them, but they must be configured in order:

    ...
    all userGroupProviders
    all accessPolicyProviders
    all Authorizers

        The FileUserGroupProvider will provide support for managing users and groups which is backed by a file
        on the local file system.

        - Users File - The file where the FileUserGroupProvider will store users and groups.

        - Legacy Authorized Users File - The full path to an existing authorized-users.xml that will be automatically
            be used to load the users and groups into the Users File.

        - Initial User Identity [unique key] - The identity of a users and systems to seed the Users File. The name of
            each property must be unique, for example: "Initial User Identity A", "Initial User Identity B",
            "Initial User Identity C" or "Initial User Identity 1", "Initial User Identity 2", "Initial User Identity 3"

            NOTE: Any identity mapping rules specified in nifi.properties will also be applied to the user identities,
            so the values should be the unmapped identities (i.e. full DN from a certificate).

        The FileAccessPolicyProvider will provide support for managing access policies which is backed by a file
        on the local file system.

        - User Group Provider - The identifier for an User Group Provider defined above that will be used to access
            users and groups for use in the managed access policies.

        - Authorizations File - The file where the FileAccessPolicyProvider will store policies.

        - Initial Admin Identity - The identity of an initial admin user that will be granted access to the UI and
            given the ability to create additional users, groups, and policies. The value of this property could be
            a DN when using certificates or LDAP, or a Kerberos principal. This property will only be used when there
            are no other policies defined. If this property is specified then a Legacy Authorized Users File can not be specified.

            NOTE: Any identity mapping rules specified in nifi.properties will also be applied to the initial admin identity,
            so the value should be the unmapped identity. This identity must be found in the configured User Group Provider.

        - Legacy Authorized Users File - The full path to an existing authorized-users.xml that will be automatically
            converted to the new authorizations model. If this property is specified then an Initial Admin Identity can
            not be specified, and this property will only be used when there are no other users, groups, and policies defined.

            NOTE: Any users in the legacy users file must be found in the configured User Group Provider.

        - Node Identity [unique key] - The identity of a NiFi cluster node. When clustered, a property for each node
            should be defined, so that every node knows about every other node. If not clustered these properties can be ignored.
            The name of each property must be unique, for example for a three node cluster:
            "Node Identity A", "Node Identity B", "Node Identity C" or "Node Identity 1", "Node Identity 2", "Node Identity 3"

            NOTE: Any identity mapping rules specified in nifi.properties will also be applied to the node identities,
            so the values should be the unmapped identities (i.e. full DN from a certificate). This identity must be found
            in the configured User Group Provider.

        The StandardManagedAuthorizer. This authorizer implementation must be configured with the
        Access Policy Provider which it will use to access and manage users, groups, and policies.
        These users, groups, and policies will be used to make all access decisions during authorization
        requests.

    <!--
        NOTE: This Authorizer has been replaced with the more granular approach configured above with the Standard
        Managed Authorizer. However, it is still available for backwards compatibility reasons.

        The FileAuthorizer is NiFi's provided authorizer and has the following properties:

        - Authorizations File - The file where the FileAuthorizer will store policies.

        - Users File - The file where the FileAuthorizer will store users and groups.

        - Initial Admin Identity - The identity of an initial admin user that will be granted access to the UI and
            given the ability to create additional users, groups, and policies. The value of this property could be
            a DN when using certificates or LDAP, or a Kerberos principal. This property will only be used when there
            are no other users, groups, and policies defined. If this property is specified then a Legacy Authorized
            Users File can not be specified.

            NOTE: Any identity mapping rules specified in nifi.properties will also be applied to the initial admin identity,
            so the value should be the unmapped identity.

        - Legacy Authorized Users File - The full path to an existing authorized-users.xml that will be automatically
            converted to the new authorizations model. If this property is specified then an Initial Admin Identity can
            not be specified, and this property will only be used when there are no other users, groups, and policies defined.

        - Node Identity [unique key] - The identity of a NiFi cluster node. When clustered, a property for each node
            should be defined, so that every node knows about every other node. If not clustered these properties can be ignored.
            The name of each property must be unique, for example for a three node cluster:
            "Node Identity A", "Node Identity B", "Node Identity C" or "Node Identity 1", "Node Identity 2", "Node Identity 3"

            so the values should be the unmapped identities (i.e. full DN from a certificate).
