  This file provides a mechanism for defining and configuring the State Providers
  that should be used for storing state locally and across a NiFi cluster. In order
  to use a specific provider, it must be configured here and its identifier
  must be specified in the nifi.properties file.

<stateManagement>
    <!--
        State Provider that stores state locally in a configurable directory. This Provider requires the following properties:
        
        Directory - the directory to store components' state in. If the directory being used is a sub-directory of the NiFi installation, it
                    is important that the directory be copied over to the new version when upgrading NiFi.
        Always Sync - If set to true, any change to the repository will be synchronized to the disk, meaning that NiFi will ask the operating system not to cache the information. This is very
                expensive and can significantly reduce NiFi performance. However, if it is false, there could be the potential for data loss if either there is a sudden power loss or the
                operating system crashes. The default value is false.
        Partitions - The number of partitions.
        Checkpoint Interval - The amount of time between checkpoints.

    <!--
        State Provider that is used to store state in ZooKeeper. This Provider requires the following properties:
        
        Root Node - the root node in ZooKeeper where state should be stored. The default is '/nifi', but it is advisable to change this to a different value if not using
                   the embedded ZooKeeper server and if multiple NiFi instances may all be using the same ZooKeeper Server.
                   
        Connect String - A comma-separated list of host:port pairs to connect to ZooKeeper. For example, myhost.mydomain:2181,host2.mydomain:5555,host3:6666
        
        Session Timeout - Specifies how long this instance of NiFi is allowed to be disconnected from ZooKeeper before creating a new ZooKeeper Session. Default value is "30 seconds"
        
        Access Control - Specifies which Access Controls will be applied to the ZooKeeper ZNodes that are created by this State Provider. This value must be set to one of:
                            - Open  : ZNodes will be open to any ZooKeeper client.
                            - CreatorOnly  : ZNodes will be accessible only by the creator. The creator will have full access to create children, read, write, delete, and administer the ZNodes.
                                             This option is available only if access to ZooKeeper is secured via Kerberos or if a Username and Password are set.
