As the front started to cross the Pennsylvania, Maryland and West Virginia Appalachians during the morning of January 1st, a low pressure system formed on the triple point of the occluded front in northeastern Virginia around 7 a.m. EST on January 1st.

The winter storm from the 12th through the 14th provided much needed precipitation to improve these areas to D1 or less. |The drought has been ongoing for over a year now, which continues the water worries over many communities. Lake levels remain at or near record lows, although the recent beneficial moisture has helped somewhat. Many boat docks and ramps remained on dry ground, but lakes are showing some improvement, rising slowly during the last half of the month. Even at low levels, most lakes are still considered at safe levels for everyday living and water rationing has been kept to a minimum.|The agriculture industry continued to be hit hard by the drought. Although many farmers are beginning the year much better than they did last year due to the recent precipitation, many are fighting to save their 2007 crops. The recent precipitation has helped the top 12 inches of the soil, but the soil below this remains very dry.

The first high wind event occurred during the afternoon and evening hours of the 5th as the upper level support was peaking. High winds were realized in many locations despite the fact that this peak occurred during the diurnally least favored time for Santa Ana winds. Wind gusts reached 75 mph at Fremont Canyon, 64 mph at Rancho Cucamonga, 63 mph at El Cariso, 59 mph at Rialto, 57 mph at Case Springs, 55 mph at Ontario. Winds were sustained 55 mph at Rancho Cucamonga, 52 mph at Fremont Canyon, and 40 mph at Ontario. Damaged or downed power poles were reported in Nuevo, Yucaipa, and Perris, while widespread damage to trees or tree limbs was reported in many other areas. Blowing dust reduced visibility to near zero along interstate 215 and the Ramona Expressway. Elsewhere, high winds in the San Bernardino Mountains near Rim Forest forced vehicles to slide across and off icy stretches of highway 18. Large trees fell onto homes and cars in the Lake Arrowhead area. Small, wind-driven wildfires were reported along interstate 15 near Mormon Rocks and the Cajon Pass. |The second high wind event occurred during the early morning hours of the 7th and the 8th. Wind gusts measured 84 mph at Fremont Canyon and 62 mph at Rialto. Sustained winds at these locations measured 51 mph and 45 mph respectively. The winds caused more damage to trees, flipped over a semi, and left numerous residents without power.|As is typical of most Santa Ana events, Fremont Canyon experienced the worst of the winds.

The first high wind event occurred during the afternoon and evening hours of the 5th as the upper level support was peaking. High winds were realized in many locations despite the fact that this peak occurred during the diurnally least favored time for Santa Ana winds. Wind gusts reached 75 mph at Fremont Canyon, 64 mph at Rancho Cucamonga, 63 mph at El Cariso, 59 mph at Rialto, 57 mph at Case Springs, 55 mph at Ontario. Winds were sustained 55 mph at Rancho Cucamonga, 52 mph at Fremont Canyon, and 40 mph at Ontario. Damaged or downed power poles were reported in Nuevo, Yucaipa, and Perris, while widespread damage to trees or tree limbs was reported in many other areas. Blowing dust reduced visibility to near zero along interstate 215 and the Ramona Expressway. Elsewhere, high winds in the San Bernardino Mountains near Rim Forest forced vehicles to slide across and off icy stretches of highway 18. Large trees fell onto homes and cars in the Lake Arrowhead area. Small, wind-driven wildfires were reported along interstate 15 near Mormon Rocks and the Cajon Pass. |The second high wind event occurred during the early morning hours of the 7th and the 8th. Wind gusts measured 84 mph at Fremont Canyon and 62 mph at Rialto. Sustained winds at these locations measured 51 mph and 45 mph respectively. The winds caused more damage to trees, flipped over a semi, and left numerous residents without power.|As is typical of most Santa Ana events, Fremont Canyon experienced the worst of the winds. Between the 5th and the 7th, Fremont Canyon RAWS measured 24 wind gusts of 60 mph or greater, 6 wind gusts of 70 mph or greater, and 2 wind gusts in excess of 80 mph.",Downed power lines sparked a 670 acre wildfire near Lake Mathews.

The combination of strong northerly winds and very low relative humidity helped fuel the man-caused fire. Although the fire was only 20 acres, it destroyed 5 homes and severly damaged 6 homes in the Malibu area, inlcuding a home owned by Suzanne Somers. Including fire suppression activities and property damage, this small wildfire cost around $60 million."",

The temperature at 500mb in the low pressure center was as low as -42C over Oregon on the 11th but the air over Central California eventually lowered to -36C by the 12th. With such a cold air pool aloft, continued cold air advection from the northerly flow kept particularly dry, frigid air in the Central and Southern San Joaquin Valley (and much of the state) from late on the 11th through the 18th of the month with little moderation. Furthermore, high pressure did not build quickly behind the frontal passage aloft but rather the cold-core low lingered. This resulted in continued upper air mixing and did not set strong low-level temperature inversions utilized by growers for freeze mitigation efforts. The low pressure aloft remained an influence for the mornings of the 12th, 13th, and 14th. For the agricultural districts, minimum temperatures in the Valley dropped to 15-17 degrees F. in the very coldest locations. Within the agricultural citrus belts, minimum temperatures ranged consistently from 19 to 24 degrees. Not only were the typical temperature inversions not readily available for freeze mitigation due to mixing from the upper low pressure aloft, but the air in the lower levels of the Central and South San Joaquin Valley remained abnormally dry for a longer period of time. The frontal passage was dry and minimal moisture persisted on the Valley floor from the much below normal winter precipitation (only December had close to seasonal rainfall with October, November, and January relatively dry). No moderation of the lower atmosphere occurred over time due to persistent low dew points (minimal surface moisture evaporation for fog formation). With no typical moderation over time by increased dew points or fog, the coldest morning within a 5-day period from the 12th through the 16th varied by location across the Valley rather than time. Fresno had its coldest morning on the 13th with a low of 23 degree F., Bakersfield dropped to 23F on the 14th, and Merced and Hanford had their lowest minimums of 19F on the 15th. Temperature durations of 14 hours below 32F, 12 hours below 28F, and even 6-10 hours below 26F on several mornings resulted in devastating damage to area citrus. Preliminary estimates of crop losses were between 50% and 70% of fruit remaining on trees (an estimated 30% of the crop had been harvested prior to the freeze.) Crop damage was estimated at almost $1.3 billion of California's annual $32 billion agricultural production with nearly $709 million in the Interior Central California ag area. The January 2007 Freeze for Central California comes in another 8-year interval behind the citrus-devastating freezes of December 1990 and December 1998. The December 1990 Freeze undoubtedly was the most devastating of these economic disasters due to the loss of citrus trees and not just total loss of the fruit. The dollar-loss for the January 2007 Freeze, being unadjusted for inflation, will be higher than the December 1998 Freeze (by about $100 million). However, the length of the coldest days in the 1998 event along with its earlier occurrence in the year makes it arguably the second worst among these events. As summarized by a grower, the December 1998 freeze took 85% of the fruit with 85% of the fruit still unharvested on the trees. The January 2007 freeze took 70% of approximately 70% of the fruit unharvested.|Much below normal minimum temperatures also resulted in numerous instances of frozen pipes, damage to water delivery systems, and subsequent further loss to nurseries and growers depending on water for assistance in the freeze fight. At least two municipalities, Earlimart (Tulare County) and Frazier Park (Kern County), had some short-term unavailability of drinking water due to minor damage from the freezing cold. Although temperatures began to show some moderation by the morning of the 17th, nights with sub-freezing temperatures continued across the agricultural areas through the morning of the 24th. Fresno (Fresno County) had 19 consecutive days with minimum temperatures of 32 degrees or lower, only 1 day less than the all-time record. One Kern County citrus grower commented toward the end of the event that his crews had been in a frost-fight mode for over 40 days (given some mid-month frost concerns in December). Due to the loss of the citurs crop, the large, unmeasureable effect of the January 2007 Freeze is the economic loss to tens of thousands of workers out of jobs in the Central and South San Joaquin Valley besides the loss to production agriculture. The impact to the Valley economy is in the billions of dollars.

Numerous long standing records were broken as temperatures dipped into the 20s and 30s along the coast, the teens in the valleys, the single digits to below zero in the mountains, and into the single digits to teens in the deserts. Except for right along the immediate coastline, the freeze lasted for up to a week or longer. Local farmers were hit the hardest by the freeze. Crop damage was estimated at $114.7 million in San Diego County, $86 million in Riverside County, and 11.1 million in San Bernardino County. All three of these counties were eventually declared Disaster Areas. Plumbing pipes froze and burst in many valley, mountain, and desert locations. For example, more than $600,000 in damage from broken pipes was reported just in the San Bernardino County mountains and deserts. The famed golf courses of the Palm Springs area didn't escape the freeze either. It will cost an estimated $20,000 just to repair one golf course in Indian Wells alone.|At the onset of the freeze, snow was reported in the valleys of San Bernardino, Riverside, and San Diego Counties at elevations as low as 500 ft. Gusty winds at times made it feel much colder. During the freeze, the air temperature dropped to 7 degrees below zero at Fawnskin, 2 degrees below zero at Big Bear Lake and Wrightwood, 5 degrees in the high desert city of Hesperia, 6 degrees at Mount Laguna in San Diego County, 8 degrees in Apple Valley, 10 degrees at the Anza-Borrego Valley Airport, 11 degrees at Idyllwild, 12 degrees near the Mexico border at Campo, 13 degrees at the top of the Palm Springs Tramway, 16 degrees at Ramona, Pine Cove, Angelus Oaks, Potrero, and Twentynine Palms, 18 degrees at Thermal, Julian, and Palomar, 19 degrees at Hemet and Moreno Valley, and 20 degrees at Chino and Camp Pendleton.

The hardest hit areas with freezing rain were Atoka, Bryan, Coal, Cotton, Hughes, Seminole, and Johnston counties. The wintry precipitation caused numerous traffic accidents with numerous indirect injuries and 14 indirect fatalities. Many trees and powers lines were downed with thousands of residents without power, mainly over southern and eastern Oklahoma. The severe cold that accompanied this storm also allowed for water main breaks in Clinton and Lawton. Other damage included school gymnasium roofs collapsed in Del City, Newcastle, two awnings collasped in Allen and Ada, and four greenhouse roofs collasped in McClain county. Also, the prolonged period of wintry precipitation closed airports, schools, malls, and other places of business. The slick and hazardous roads caused many schools to remained closed for several days after the winter precipitation had ended.",,"{

A large area of brick was ejected from an upper portion of the Building???s north wall.  The conclusion of the survey team was that this damage at the Police Headquarters was due to a small and short-lived tornado that occurred just behind the 70 to 80 mph thunderstorm winds. Damage was also found about 200 yards north of the Police Building at a business that manufactures lighting fixtures.  This was thought to be a second touchdown of the small tornado.  Here a large dumpster was spun almost 360 degrees and several trailers were slammed into each other. A single-wide trailer was tipped over on its side.  Windows and doors at the building were broken, with some blown inward and some blown outward.  Based on the type and level of damage, the tornado was rated an F1 on the Fujita Scale, and an EF1 on the new Enhanced Fujita Scale.

His car???in spite of being somewhat sheltered???was badly damaged by the blowing debris.  In all???thirty-five vehicles at the Police Building sustained damage???with numerous dents and large gashes in car bodies???as well as windows and windshields fractured.  A large area of brick was ejected from an upper portion of the Building???s north wall.  The conclusion of the survey team was that this damage at the Police Headquarters was due to a small and short-lived tornado that occurred just behind the 70 to 80 mph thunderstorm winds. Damage was also found about 200 yards north of the Police Building at a business that manufactures lighting fixtures.  This was thought to be a second touchdown of the small tornado.  Here a large dumpster was spun almost 360 degrees and several trailers were slammed into each other. A single-wide trailer was tipped over on its side.  Windows and doors at the building were broken, with some blown inward and some blown outward.  Based on the type and level of damage, the tornado was rated an F1 on the Fujita Scale, and an EF1 on the new Enhanced Fujita Scale.  The tornado path was estimated to be 100 yards wide and a three-tenths of a mile long."",

Over 150,000 customers were without power at one time during the ice storm. Many were without power for 2 days, and some for over 3 days.

    ""Description"": ""A low pressure system over the midwest moved east, reaching south central New York State around midday on Monday, January 15th, and then moved off the southern New England coast by Monday evening.|Cold low level air remained in place as precipitation overspread the region early Monday morning, producing a mix of freezing rain and some sleet. Significant icing, with ice accretions of one half of an inch, to up to one inch, occurred from the freezing rain during Monday, leading to widespread power outages from downed trees and tree limbs, and from power transformers which shorted out. Although the freezing rain tapered off Monday evening, strengthening winds in the wake of the storm continued to down tree limbs and exacerbate power outages across the region into Monday night.|This ice storm had a significant impact on travel and economy across the region. Estimates of 85,000 customers across east central New York State were affected by power outages at the height of the ice storm Monday afternoon and evening, with approximately 45,000 without power in Saratoga county. Some of these customers did not receive power back until Thursday, January 18th."",

The serious problems were associated with coatings of freezing rain and drizzle that varied from one-half inch to three-quarters of an inch in thickness.  In many locations, schools and businesses and local offices were already closed on January 15 due to the Martin Luther King Holiday and simply did not re-open until Wednesday, January 16, or Thursday, January 17.

In many locations, schools and businesses and local offices were already closed on January 15 due to the Martin Luther King Holiday and simply did not re-open until Wednesday, January 16, or Thursday, January 17.  Hundreds of accidents were reported on interstate highways as well as city and rural roads, causing additional closures and problems.  Most area schools were closed on January 16 as a result of the storm.","Freezing rain and drizzle began in Wilson County near 10 pm on the evening of January 15.  By early the next morning, the accumulation of ice had forced the closing of most bridges and roads.  The ice also caused power outages to nearly 2000 county residents, with the worst problems reported in Stockdale, Eagle Creek, and Creekwood.  Most schools, public offices, and businesses in the county were closed on January 16, with some still closed on January 17.","{
