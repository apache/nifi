# Security Vulnerability Disclosure

Apache NiFi welcomes the responsible reporting of security vulnerabilities. The NiFi team believes that working with skilled security researchers across the globe is crucial in identifying weaknesses in any technology. If you believe you've found a security issue in our product or service, we encourage you to notify us. We will work with you to resolve the issue promptly.

## Table of Contents

* [Disclosure Policy](#disclosure-policy)
* [Exclusions](#exclusions)
* [Reporting Methods](#reporting-methods)
* [Publishing](#publishing)

## Disclosure Policy

* Let us know as soon as possible upon discovery of a potential security issue, and we'll make every effort to quickly resolve the issue.
* Provide us a reasonable amount of time to resolve the issue before any disclosure to the public or a third-party.
* Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our service. Only interact with accounts you own or with explicit permission of the account holder.

## Exclusions

While researching, we'd like to ask you to refrain from:
* Denial of service
* Spamming
* Social engineering (including phishing) of Apache NiFi staff or contractors
* Any physical attempts against Apache NiFi property or data centers

## Reporting Methods

NiFi accepts reports in multiple ways:

* Send an email to [security@nifi.apache.org](mailto:security@nifi.apache.org). This is a private list monitored by the [PMC](https://nifi.apache.org/people.html). For sensitive disclosures, the GPG key fingerprint is *1230 3BB8 1F22 E11C 8725 926A AFF2 B368 23B9 44E9*.
* NiFi has a [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/apache_nifi) project page. HackerOne provides a triaged process for researchers and organizations to collaboratively report and resolve security vulnerabilities.

## Publishing

Apache NiFi follows the [ASF Project Security For Committers](https://www.apache.org/security/committers.html) policy. Thus, any vulnerability is not disclosed by the project until a released version which mitigates the issue is available for download. Once this release is available, the issue is fully documented in the following locations:
* An email is sent to the same addresses as the release announcement (dev@nifi.apache.org, users@nifi.apache.org, announce@apache.org), security@nifi.apache.org, and oss-security@lists.openwall.com
* The [Mitre Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database](https://cveform.mitre.org/)
* The [Apache NiFi Security Page](https://nifi.apache.org/security.html)

Thank you for helping keep Apache NiFi and our users safe!
