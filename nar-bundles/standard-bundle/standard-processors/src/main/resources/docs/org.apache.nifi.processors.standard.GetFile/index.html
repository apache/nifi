            in bold. Any other properties (not in bold) are considered optional.
            If a property has a default value, it is indicated. If a property
            supports the use of the NiFi Expression Language (or simply,
            "expression language"), that is also indicated.</p>

                        copy of the file in the input directory after retrieving it; this
                        causes the file to be picked up continually and is useful for

                        followed by a time unit, such as nanos, millis, secs, mins, hrs, days. <b>NOTE:</b> If a directory
                        listing is empty, the processor will yield for the full yield duration and will not poll during that

                    <li>The minimum age that a file must be in order to be pulled;
