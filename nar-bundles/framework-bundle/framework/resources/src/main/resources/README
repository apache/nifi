***********************************************
Introduction

Apache NiFi is a dataflow system based on the concepts of flow-based programming. It is currently apart of the Apache Incubator.

***********************************************
Features

Apache NiFi supports powerful and scalable directed graphs of data routing, transformation, and system mediation logic. Some of the high-level capabilities and objectives of Apache NiFi include:

- Web-based user interface for seamless experience between design, control, feedback, and monitoring of data flows
- Highly configurable along several dimensions of quality of service such as loss tolerant versus guaranteed delivery, low latency versus high throughput, and priority based queuing
- Fine-grained data provenance for all data received, forked, joined, cloned, modified, sent, and ultimately dropped as data reaches its configured end-state
- Component-based extension model along well defined interfaces enabling rapid development and effective testing 

************************************************
Getting Started

Execute <nifi install dir>/bin/nifi.sh start

**************************************************
Disclaimer

Apache NiFi is an effort undergoing incubation at the Apache Software
Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Incubator PMC.

Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review
indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process
have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects.

While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness
or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be
fully endorsed by the ASF.

Export Control

This distribution includes cryptographic software. The country in which you 
currently reside may have restrictions on the import, possession, use, and/or
re-export to another country, of encryption software. BEFORE using any 
encryption software, please check your country's laws, regulations and 
policies concerning the import, possession, or use, and re-export of encryption
software, to see if this is permitted. See <http://www.wassenaar.org/> for more
information.

The U.S. Government Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security 
(BIS), has classified this software as Export Commodity Control Number (ECCN) 
5D002.C.1, which includes information security software using or performing 
cryptographic functions with asymmetric algorithms. The form and manner of this
Apache Software Foundation distribution makes it eligible for export under the 
License Exception ENC Technology Software Unrestricted (TSU) exception (see the
BIS Export Administration Regulations, Section 740.13) for both object code and
source code.

The following provides more details on the included cryptographic software: 

Apache NiFi uses BouncyCastle, Jasypt, JCraft Inc., and the built-in 
java cryptography libraries for SSL, SSH, and the protection
of sensitive configuration parameters. See
