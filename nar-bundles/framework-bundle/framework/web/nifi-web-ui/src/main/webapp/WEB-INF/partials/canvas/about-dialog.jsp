            NiFi is a framework to support highly scalable and flexible dataflow scaling from a
            laptop through an enterprise class server handling just a few transfers per day or millions.
            Instead of dictating a particular dataflow or behavior it empowers you to design your own
            optimal dataflow tailored to your specific environment.
