        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>
        	This Processors puts the contents of a FlowFile to a Topic in 
        	<a href="http://kafka.apache.org/">Apache Kafka</a>. The full contents of
        	a FlowFile becomes the contents of a single message in Kafka.
        	This message is optionally assigned a key by using the
        	&lt;Kafka Key&gt; Property.
        </p>


        <p>
            <strong>Properties:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>In the list below, the names of required properties appear
            in bold. Any other properties (not in bold) are considered optional.
            If a property has a default value, it is indicated. If a property
            supports the use of the NiFi Expression Language (or simply,
            "expression language"), that is also indicated.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Known Brokers</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                    	A comma-separated list of known Kafka Brokers in the format 
                    	&lgt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;. This list does not need to be
                    	exhaustive but provides a mechanism for determining which
                    	other nodes belong to the Kafka cluster.
                    </li>
                    <li>Default value: no default</li>
                    <li>Supports expression language: false</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Topic Name</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Kafka Topic to send messages to. While the GetKafka
                    	Processor requires a statically named Topic so that it knows
                    	where to fetch messages from, the PutKafka Processor does allow
                    	the Expression Language to be used so that a single PutKafka
                    	Processor can be used to send messages to many different Kafka
                    	topics.
                    </li>
                    <li>Default value: no default</li>
                    <li>Supports expression language: true</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            
            <li>Kafka Key
                <ul>
                    <li>
                    	The Key to use for the Message. If no value is given, the message
                    	will not be given a Key.
                    </li>
                    <li>Default value: no default</li>
                    <li>Supports expression language: true</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Delivery Guarantee</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                    	Specifies the requirement for guaranteeing that a message is sent to Kafka.
                    	This Property can have one of three different values:
                    	<ul>
                    		<li>
                    			<b>Guarantee Replicated Delivery</b> - FlowFile will be routed to 
	                    			failure unless the message is replicated to the appropriate number 
	                    			of Kafka Nodes according to the Topic configuration
	                    	</li>
                    		<li>
                    			<b>Guarantee Single Node Delivery</b> - FlowFile will be routed to 
                    				success if the message is received by a single Kafka node, 
                    				whether or not it is replicated. This is faster than 
                    				&lt;Guarantee Replicated Delivery&gt; but can result in data loss 
                    				if a Kafka node crashes
                    		</li>
                    		<li>
                    			<b>Best Effort</b> - FlowFile will be routed to success after successfully 
                    				writing the content to a Kafka node, without waiting for a response. 
                    				This provides the best performance but may result in data loss.
                    		</li>
                    	</ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Default value: Best Effort</li>
                    <li>Supports expression language: false</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Communications Timeout</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                    	The amount of time to wait for a response from Kafka before determining 
                    	that there is a communications error
                    </li>
                    <li>Default value: 30 secs</li>
                    <li>Supports expression language: false</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Max FlowFile Size</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                    	Specifies the amount of data that can be buffered to send to Kafka. Because
                    	the contents of the FlowFile must be buffered into memory before they can
                    	be sent to Kafka, attempting to send a very large FlowFile can cause
                    	problems by causing the machine to run out of memory.
                    	This helps to prevent the system from running out of memory, the PutKafka
                    	Processor exposes a property for specifying the maximum size of a FlowFile.
                    	If the size of a FlowFile is larger than this, that FlowFile will be routed to 'reject'.
                    </li>
                    <li>Default value: 1 MB</li>
                    <li>Supports expression language: false</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Client Name</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Client Name to use when communicating with Kafka</li>
                    <li>Default value: "NiFi-" followed by the UUID of the Processor</li>
