# Note: the following mapping properties only apply if a Sensitive Property Provider that uses property contexts
# is configured.  Otherwise, these values are ignored.
#
# If no nifi.registry.bootstrap.protection.xml.context.location.mapping.* properties are provided, the context for protected
# properties uses their filename as a location prefix, e.g. "authorizers.xml||Manager Password".
# This creates a separate context for each unique property name in each XML configuration file.
#
# However, to reuse the same context in a more logical fashion, context mappings may be provided, in the format:
# nifi.registry.bootstrap.protection.xml.context.location.mapping.<contextLocation>=<identifier matching regex>
# With the following configuration, for example, any XML property named "Manager Password" located inside
# an XML block whose <identifier> starts with "ldap-" will be mapped to the context named "ldap||Manager Password",
# regardless of whether it resides in authorizers.xml or login-identity-providers.xml.
