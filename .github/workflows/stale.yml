          stale-pr-message: >
            Automated review is marking this PR as stale due to lack of updates in the past four months.
            This PR will be closed in 15 days if the stale label is not removed.
            This stale label and automated closure does not indicate a judgement of the PR, just
            lack of reviewer bandwidth and helps us keep the PR queue more manageable.  If you would
            like this PR re-opened you can do so and a committer can remove the stale label.  Or you can
            open a new PR.  Try to help review other PRs to increase PR review bandwidth which in
            turn helps yours.
