          stale-pr-message: >
            We're marking this PR as stale due to lack of updates in the past few months.
            If after another couple of weeks the stale label has not been removed this PR will be closed.
            This stale marker and eventual auto close does not indicate a judgement of the PR just
            lack of reviewer bandwidth and helps us keep the PR queue more manageable.  If you would
            like this PR re-opened you can do so and a committer can remove the stale tag.  Or you can
            open a new PR.  Try to help review other PRs to increase PR review bandwidth which in
            turn helps yours.
