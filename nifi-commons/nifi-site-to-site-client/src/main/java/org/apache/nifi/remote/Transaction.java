/**
 * <p>
 * Provides a transaction for performing site-to-site data transfers.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * A Transaction is created by calling the
 * {@link org.apache.nifi.remote.client.SiteToSiteClient#createTransaction(TransferDirection) createTransaction(TransferDirection)}
 * method of a
 * {@link org.apache.nifi.remote.client.SiteToSiteClient SiteToSiteClient}. The
 * resulting Transaction can be used to either send or receive data but not
 * both. A new Transaction must be created in order perform the other operation.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The general flow of execute of a Transaction is as follows:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Create the transaction as described above.</li>
 * <li>Send data via the {@link #send(DataPacket)} method or receive data via
 * the {@link #receive()} method. This method will be called 1 or more times. In
 * the case of receive, this method should be called until the method returns
 * {@code null}, signifying that the remote instance is finished sending data.
 * <b>Note:</b> <code>receive()</code> should not be called a second time
 * without first fully consuming the stream from the previous Packet that was
 * received.</li>
 * <li>Confirm the transaction via the {@link #confirm()} method.</li>
 * <li>Either complete the transaction via the {@link #complete(boolean)} method
 * or cancel the transaction via the {@link #cancel()} method.</li>
 * </ol>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * It is important that the Transaction be terminated in order to free the
 * resources held by the Transaction. If a Transaction is not terminated, its
 * resources will not be freed and if the Transaction holds connections from a
 * connection pool, the connections in that pool will eventually become
 * exhausted. A Transaction is terminated by calling one of the following
 * methods:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #complete(boolean)}</li>
 * <li>{@link #cancel()}</li>
 * <li>{@link #error()}</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * If at any point an IOException is thrown from one of the methods of the
 * Transaction, that Transaction is automatically closed via a call to
 * {@link #error()}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The Transaction class should not be assumed to be thread-safe.
 * </p>
