/**
 * Simple model of operations. The current approach is to capture a shared state ( via agent(s)
 * and C2 server. This operation ID correspond with an operation requested of an agent. The OperationState
 * is the state of the operation at response time. The phrase 'state' is intentional to imply that
 * the state of the operation is transient and can potentially be different across attempts.
 * <p>
 * This may suggest that a retry interval/attempt be added. Additionally, the details may provide user
 * feedback; however, it may be useful to separate failures into pre and post conditions. Details may provide
 * some insight, but a pre-condition and post-condition failure may better indicate how to arrive at operational
 * success.
