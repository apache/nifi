      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,

      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the

      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

    This formulation of W3C's notice and license became active on December 31 2002.
    This version removes the copyright ownership notice such that this license can
    be used with materials other than those owned by the W3C, reflects that ERCIM
    is now a host of the W3C, includes references to this specific dated version of
    the license, and removes the ambiguous grant of "use". Otherwise, this version
    is the same as the previous version and is written so as to preserve the Free
    Software Foundation's assessment of GPL compatibility and OSI's certification
    under the Open Source Definition. Please see our Copyright FAQ for common

  SOFTWARE RIGHTS

  ANTLR 1989-2006 Developed by Terence Parr
  Partially supported by University of San Francisco & jGuru.com

  We reserve no legal rights to the ANTLR--it is fully in the
  public domain. An individual or company may do whatever
  they wish with source code distributed with ANTLR or the
  code generated by ANTLR, including the incorporation of
  ANTLR, or its output, into commerical software.

  We encourage users to develop software with ANTLR. However,
  we do ask that credit is given to us for developing
  ANTLR. By "credit", we mean that if you use ANTLR or
  incorporate any source code into one of your programs
  (commercial product, research project, or otherwise) that
  you acknowledge this fact somewhere in the documentation,
  research report, etc... If you like ANTLR and have
  developed a nice tool with the output, please mention that
  you developed it using ANTLR. In addition, we ask that the
  headers remain intact in our source code. As long as these
  guidelines are kept, we expect to continue enhancing this
  system and expect to make other tools available as they are
  completed.

  Eclipse Public License - v 2.0

  THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC LICENSE
  (“AGREEMENT”). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS
  AGREEMENT.

  1. Definitions

  “Contribution” means:

  a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content Distributed under this Agreement, and b) in the case
  of each subsequent Contributor: i) changes to the Program, and ii) additions to the Program; where such changes
  and/or additions to the Program originate from and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
  “originates” from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such
  Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that are not Modified Works.
  “Contributor” means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.

  “Licensed Patents” mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale
   of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.

  “Program” means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this Agreement.

  “Recipient” means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement or any Secondary License (as applicable),
  including Contributors.

  “Derivative Works” shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other form, that is based on (or derived from) the
  Program and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a
  whole, an original work of authorship.

  “Modified Works” shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that results from an addition to, deletion from,
  or modification of the contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file in Source Code form
  that contains any contents of the Program. Modified Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
  interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely in each case in order to link to, bind by
  name, or subclass the Program or Modified Works thereof.

  “Distribute” means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available in any manner that enables the transfer of a
  copy.

  “Source Code” means the form of a Program preferred for making modifications, including but not limited to software
  source code, documentation source, and configuration files.

  “Secondary License” means either the GNU General Public License, Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license,
  including any exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial Contributor.

  2. Grant of Rights

  a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide,
  royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
  Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.

  b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide,
  royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer
  the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall apply to the
  combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
  addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall
  not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.

  c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein,
  no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual
  property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any
  other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
  rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other
  intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow
  Recipient to Distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing
  the Program.

  d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any,
  to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.

  e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient
  (other than those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's receipt of the Program under the
  terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).

  3. Requirements

  3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:

  a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must
  accompany the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program is available under this Agreement, and
  informs Recipients how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software
  exchange; and

  b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license different than this Agreement, provided that such
  license:

  i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied,
  including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of
  merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;

  ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect,
  special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;

  iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights in the Source Code under section 3.2; and

  iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any party to be under a license that satisfies the
  requirements of this section 3.

  3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:

  a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the Program (i) is combined with other material in a
  separate file or files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial Contributor attached to the
  Source Code the notice described in Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available under the
  terms of such Secondary Licenses, and

  b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.

  3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent, trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of
  warranty, or limitations of liability (“notices”) contained within the Program from any copy of the Program which
  they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add their own appropriate notices.

  4. Commercial Distribution

  Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners
  and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who
  includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
  liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product
  offering, such Contributor (“Commercial Contributor”) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor
  (“Indemnified Contributor”) against any losses, damages and costs (collectively “Losses”) arising from claims,
  lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused
  by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a
  commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any
  actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a)
  promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to
  control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations.
  The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.

  For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor
  is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties
  related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
  alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors
  related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any
  damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.

  5. No Warranty

  EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS
  PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING,
  WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
  PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
  distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
  including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or
  loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

  6. Disclaimer of Liability

  EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT
  NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR
  CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY,
  WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE
  OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
  OF SUCH DAMAGES.

  7. General

  If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the
  validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the
  parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and
  enforceable.

  If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
  alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes
  such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date
  such litigation is filed.

  All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or
  conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of
  such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and
  distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement
  and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.

  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the
  Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right
  to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
  Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse
  Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new
  version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may
  always be Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new
  version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
  Contributions) under the new version.

  Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the
  intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or
  otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this
  Agreement is intended to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient. No third-party
  beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.

  Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice

  “This Source Code may also be made available under the following Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such
  availability set forth in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s), version(s), and
  exceptions or additional permissions here}.” Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A is
  not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.

  If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file, then You may include the notice in a
  location (such as a LICENSE file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a
  notice.

  You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.
