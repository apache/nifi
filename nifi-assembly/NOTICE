      includes, but is not limited to, any warranty of the quality,
      performance, merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose of
      the program and the nonexistence of any infringement or violation of
      any right of any third party.

      Each user of the program will agree and understand, and be deemed to
      have agreed and understood, that there is no warranty whatsoever for
      the program and, accordingly, the entire risk arising from or
      otherwise connected with the program is assumed by the user.

      Therefore, neither ICOT, the copyright holder, or any other
      organization that participated in or was otherwise related to the
      development of the program and their respective officials, directors,
      officers and other employees shall be held liable for any and all
      damages, including, without limitation, general, special, incidental
      and consequential damages, arising out of or otherwise in connection
      with the use or inability to use the program or any product, material
      or result produced or otherwise obtained by using the program,
      regardless of whether they have been advised of, or otherwise had
      knowledge of, the possibility of such damages at any time during the
      project or thereafter.  Each user will be deemed to have agreed to the
      foregoing by his or her commencement of use of the program.  The term
      "use" as used herein includes, but is not limited to, the use,
      modification, copying and distribution of the program and the
      production of secondary products from the program.

      In the case where the program, whether in its original form or
      modified, was distributed or delivered to or received by a user from
      any person, organization or entity other than ICOT, unless it makes or
      grants independently of ICOT any specific warranty to the user in
      writing, such person, organization or entity, will also be exempted
      from and not be held liable to the user for any such damages as noted
      above as far as the program is concerned.
