            Apache NiFi (incubating) is a framework to support highly scalable and flexible dataflows.
            It can be run on on laptops up through clusters of enterprise class servers.
            Instead of dictating a particular dataflow or behavior it empowers you to design your own
            optimal dataflow tailored to your specific environment.
