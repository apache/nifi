        <h2>Usage Example</h2>
        <p>
            This processor routes FlowFiles based on their attributes
            using the NiFi Expression Language. Users add properties with
            valid NiFi Expression Language Expressions as the values. Each Expression must
            return a value of type Boolean (true or false).
        </p>
        <p>
            Example: The goal is to route all files with filenames that start with ABC down a certain path. 
            Add a property with the following name and value:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>property name</strong>: ABC
            </li>
            <li><strong>property value</strong>: ${filename:startsWith('ABC')}
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In this example, all files with filenames that start with ABC will follow the ABC relationship.
