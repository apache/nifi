        <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong> The underlying JsonPath library loads the entirety of the streamed content into and performs
            result evaluations in memory. Accordingly, it is important to consider the anticipated profile of content being
            evaluated by this processor and the hardware supporting it especially when working against large JSON documents.

        <p>
            This processor adds user-defined attributes if the &lt;Destination&gt; property is set to
            <code>flowfile-attribute</code>.
