// This document refers to NiFi version 1.11.4 and to 1.22.0 as well. Where you see 1.22.0, the steps were verified against that version.
// Technically we could rename all 1.11.4 references to 1.22.0, because we are trying to be backward compatible, but it is better to double check.

== Purpose
The intent of this document is to provide a canonical source of prescriptive instruction sets for common administrator and user tasks using Apache NiFi. It is intended to complement the link:overview.html[NiFi Overview^], link:administration-guide.html[NiFi System Administrator's Guide^], and link:user-guide.html[NiFi User's Guide^]. Those documents provide extensive reference information about various features and configuration values, but they do not provide information on _how_ to accomplish tasks.

This document is _not_ intended to be a comprehensive repository of all possible admin or user activities, but rather a collection of well-documented reference activities which can be followed directly or adapted to custom scenarios. This document requires continued updates as application or ecosystem behavior changes, and corrections and improvements where the content is unclear to the community. To contribute to this document, please link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/CreateIssue!default.jspa[open a Jira^] (see link:https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/NIFI/Contributor+Guide#ContributorGuide-WheretoStart?[further instructions in the Contributor Guide^]) and link:https://github.com/apache/nifi/pulls[submit a pull request (PR)^].

NOTE: This document is provided with no warranty. All steps have been evaluated for correctness to the extent possible by the Apache NiFi community, but no responsibility is assumed for negative impacts on any computer system where these commands are executed.

== Installing Apache NiFi

Apache NiFi is an easy to use, powerful, and reliable system to process and distribute data. It supports powerful and scalable directed graphs of data routing, transformation, and system mediation logic. In addition to NiFi, there is the NiFi Toolkit, a collection of command-line tools which help perform administrative tasks such as interacting with remote services, managing nodes in a cluster, and encrypting sensitive configuration values.

|Description        | Instructions on downloading the Apache NiFi application and Toolkit
|Purpose            | To make the application available to run on the specified machine (e.g. a local development environment)
|Starting Point     | Machine running modern OS
|Expected Outcome   | Latest version of Apache NiFi available to run on host with no configuration
|Estimated Duration | 1 minute + download time
|=======================================================================================================================

NOTE: The following instructions are for installing a single node of NiFi. This guide assumes macOS 10.11.0+ but should work for any modern operating system. *nix commands are used by default, but Windows equivalents are provided where available.

. Go to the link:http://nifi.apache.org/download/[Apache NiFi Downloads^] page.
. Download the latest version of NiFi via the compressed binary files. For example, if the latest version is 1.11.4:
* `nifi-1.11.4-bin.tar.gz` [1.2 GB]
* `nifi-toolkit-1.11.4-bin.tar.gz` [42 MB]
. If you are directed to a mirror page, click the first link on the page to download the respective archive file.
+
image::install-download-link.png["Download site"]
. Note that the `nifi-1.11.4-bin.tar.gz` and the `nifi-toolkit-1.11.4-bin.tar.gz` compressed files are downloaded to your `Downloads` folder.
. Download the GPG signature and checksums for those files. They are found on the initial download page next to each binary file.
* `gpg --verify -v nifi-1.11.4-bin.tar.gz.asc` -- Verifies the GPG signature provided on the binary by the Release Manager (RM). See link:https://nifi.apache.org/gpg.html#verifying-a-release-signature[NiFi GPG Guide: Verifying a Release Signature^] for further details
* `shasum -a 256 nifi-1.11.4-bin.tar.gz` -- Calculates a SHA-256 checksum over the downloaded artifact. This should be compared with the contents of `nifi-1.11.4-bin.tar.gz.sha256` for equality
* `shasum -a 512 nifi-1.11.4-bin.tar.gz` -- Calculates a SHA-512 checksum over the downloaded artifact. This should be compared with the contents of `nifi-1.11.4-bin.tar.gz.sha512` for equality
+
image::verify-release-gpg-and-checksums.png["Verifying the GPG signature and checksums]
. Extract the files from each `tar.gz` file. This can be done by double-clicking on the files in the Finder or running the following commands in the terminal.
  * `tar -xvzf nifi-1.11.4-bin.tar.gz` -- Uncompresses the `gzip` file and extracts the `tar` archive contents to `nifi-1.11.4/`
  * `tar -xvzf nifi-toolkit-1.11.4-bin.tar.gz` -- Uncompresses the `gzip` file and extracts the `tar` archive contents to `nifi-toolkit-1.11.4/`
. Optionally, move the folders to a more appropriate location.

== Starting NiFi

|=======================================================================================================================
|Description        | Instructions on running the Apache NiFi application
|Purpose            | To configure and run the application on the local machine
|Starting Point     | <<installing-apache-nifi,Installing Apache NiFi>> or <<building-nifi-from-source,Building NiFi from Source>>
|Expected Outcome   | Latest version of Apache NiFi running on host with minimal configuration
|Estimated Duration | 1 minute
|=======================================================================================================================

. Start in the directory where NiFi was downloaded and unarchived or built. For this section, the directory `/etc/nifi-1.11.4` will be used. This directory will be referred to as the "NiFi home directory" and can be set explicitly (this is not done automatically by NiFi nor is it required).
* `export NIFI_HOME="/etc/nifi-1.11.4/"` -- Sets an environment variable (`$NIFI_HOME`) which references the installation directory (optional)
* `cd /etc/nifi-1.11.4` -- Changes the terminal to the NiFi home directory
* `ls -alGh` -- Lists the contents of the directory (optional)
+
image::nifi-home-dir-listing.png["NiFi Home directory contents"]
. At this point, NiFi can be started with default configuration values (available at link:http://localhost:8080/nifi[`http://localhost:8080/nifi`^]).
* `./bin/nifi.sh start` -- Starts NiFi. (It takes some time for NiFi to finish scheduling all components. Issuing `bin/nifi.sh start` executes the `nifi.sh` script that starts NiFi in the
background and then exits. If you want `nifi.sh` to wait for NiFi to finish scheduling all components before exiting, use the `--wait-for-init` flag with an optional timeout specified in seconds:
`bin/nifi.sh start --wait-for-init 120`. If the timeout is not provided, the default timeout of 15 minutes will be used.)
* `tail -f logs/nifi-app.log` -- Tails the application log which will indicate when the application has started
+
image::nifi-app-log-ui-available.png["NiFi application log listing available URLS"]
. Navigate to the URL in a web browser (link:http://localhost:8080/nifi[`http://localhost:8080/nifi`^] or any listed in the `nifi-app.log` output).
+
image::nifi-application-running-browser.png["NiFi application running in browser"]

=== Modification of Configuration Values
Many web applications run on `:8080` by default, so this port may already be occupied on the machine. This section will demonstrate changing the port used by NiFi. All of the following commands are run from `$NIFI_HOME`.

. Ensure the application is not running.
* `ps -ef | grep nifi` -- Checks the running system for any processes referencing `nifi` (optional)
* `./bin/nifi.sh status` -- Determines if the specified instance is running (optional)
* `./bin/nifi.sh stop` -- Stops the specified instance
. Open the main configuration file for NiFi (`nifi.properties`). Any text editor is sufficient for this (Sublime Text, Atom, vi, nano, etc.)
* `$EDITOR conf/nifi.properties` -- Opens the `nifi.properties` file for editing
. Change `nifi.web.http.port=8080` -> `nifi.web.http.port=7777` -- Sets the HTTP port to a new value
+
NOTE: Setting a port between 1 - 1024 requires `root` access on *nix systems
. Save and close the file.
. Start NiFi again
* `./bin/nifi.sh start` -- Starts NiFi
* `tail -f logs/nifi-app.log` -- Tails the application log
. Open a web browser to the new address (link:http://localhost:7777/nifi[`http://localhost:7777/nifi`^])

== Securing NiFi with TLS

Apache NiFi requires link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security[Transport Layer Security (TLS)^] configuration for multiple reasons.

. To encrypt communication between clients and server (this provides confidentialty and integrity over transmitted data)
. To prevent malicious users from intercepting data or impersonating the server
. To enable any authentication & authorization mechanisms

NiFi intentionally does not allow any authentication or authorization features over plaintext HTTP. Without the confidentiality and integrity provided by TLS and the user & group access controls, any malicious entity can intercept and modify NiFi API requests, corrupt and steal data, and otherwise interfere with the NiFi instance. Because of NiFi's robust feature set, this can even lead to complete control over the host running NiFi. For more information, see link:administration-guide.html#security_configuration[Administrator's Guide: Security Configuration^].

=== Securing NiFi with Provided Certificates

NOTE: This section assumes an enterprise IT department or other mechanism to provide signed certificates.

|=======================================================================================================================
|Description        | Instructions on enabling link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security[Transport Layer Security (TLS)^] for the Apache NiFi application using provided certificates
|Purpose            | Securing NiFi with TLS protects data in motion and is required to enable authentication & authorization
|Starting Point     | <<starting-nifi>>
|Expected Outcome   | Latest version of Apache NiFi running on host over TLS with client certificate authentication and authorization enabled and a single configured user
|Estimated Duration | 10 minutes
|=======================================================================================================================

In this scenario, a commercial CA is used, but it could also be an enterprise CA with an internal CA certificate which is configured to be trusted by corporate machines. There are many commercial vendors providing signed certificates. For this example, link:https://tinycert.org[TinyCert^] is used as it is free. link:https://letsencrypt.org[Let's Encrypt^] is another free provider, but requires verification of hostname ownership which involves additional steps not shown here.

For this scenario, all certificates and keys will be in link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy-Enhanced_Mail[Privacy-Enhanced Mail (PEM)^] format. This is a common format for certificates and keys. It uses Base64 encoding for the contents of the files, and can be transmitted across various mediums and storage mechanisms easily. Plain text editors can be used to view the contents, and the `openssl` and `keytool` tools can parse the contents.

The prerequisites for the scenario (issued by the IT department):

* A signed NiFi server certificate for the specified host (`secure.nifi` for this example) in PEM format (`nifi.pem`)
* The matching private key in PEM format (`nifi.key`)
* A signed client certificate for the specified user (`CN=my_username, ...` for this example) in PEM format (`client.pem`)
* The matching private key in PEM format (`client.key`)
* The CA certificate in PEM format (`cacert.pem`)

The end result will consist of a self-signed external CA (the root), a keystore and truststore containing the necessary certificates for the NiFi instance to operate, and a client certificate for a human user to access NiFi.

WARNING: Depending on the version of Java used, some commands below may display a warning `Warning:
The JKS keystore uses a proprietary format. It is recommended to migrate to PKCS12 which is an industry standard format using "keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore keystore.jks -destkeystore keystore.jks -deststoretype pkcs12".` As of version 1.11.4, NiFi still handles JKS keystores better than PKCS12 keystores, but either is acceptable. This may change in future versions. PKCS12 keystores are used for client certificates and keys as browsers prefer loading this format.

. Start in the directory where NiFi was downloaded and unarchived. For this section, the directory `/etc/nifi-1.11.4` will be used. This directory will be referred to as the "NiFi home directory" and can be set explicitly (this is not done automatically by NiFi nor is it required).
* `export NIFI_HOME="/etc/nifi-1.11.4/"` -- Sets an environment variable (`$NIFI_HOME`) which references the installation directory (optional)
* `cd /etc/nifi-1.11.4` -- Changes the terminal to the NiFi home directory
* `ls -alGh` -- Lists the contents of the directory (optional)
+
image::nifi-home-dir-listing.png["NiFi Home directory contents"]
. Determine if the server certificate (`nifi.pem`) contains the complete certificate chain or just the server certificate. If the sequence `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----` occurs only once, this is just the server certificate. If it occurs multiple times, the certificate chain is present. If the certificate chain is present, continue with Step 4. If it is not present, continue to Step 3.
* `cat nifi.pem` -- Prints the Base64-encoded contents
. Concatenate the server certificate and CA certificate to form the certificate chain.
* `cat cacert.pem >> nifi.pem` -- Concatenates the CA certificate to the NiFi server certificate in the proper order
. Form the PKCS12 keystore from the certificate chain and private key.
* `openssl pkcs12 -export -out nifi.p12 -inkey nifi.key -in nifi.pem -name nifi-key` -- Generates the PKCS12 keystore containing the private key and certificate chain under the alias `nifi-key`. The command will prompt for an *export password*. Choose a secure password and enter it twice for confirmation (for this scenario, the *bad* example `passwordpassword` is used)
* `keytool -list -v -keystore nifi.p12` -- Verifies the contents of the PKCS12 keystore (optional). This command will prompt for the same password entered on the previous step

NOTE: The certificate chain length is 2, starting with the server certificate and including the CA certificate.

== Deploying a NiFi Cluster

Apache NiFi can run in either _standalone_ or _clustered_ mode. A standalone node is often sufficient for dataflow operations, but in a production or high-volume environment, a cluster is more performant and resilient. For more information, see link:administration-guide.html#clustering[NiFi Administrator's Guide: Clustering^].

=== Configuring a Host to Resolve Arbitrary DNS Hostnames

NOTE: This section provides instructions to configure a single host machine to resolve dynamic hostnames via DNS using a tool called `dnsmasq`. This is useful if deploying a NiFi cluster to a single host machine to logically separate nodes running side-by-side. There are many options to achieve this outcome; this is one approach.

|=======================================================================================================================
|Description        | Instructions on installing and configuring dynamic DNS hostname resolution
|Purpose            | A NiFi cluster with multiple nodes needs to communicate between them and if all nodes are `localhost`, this is confusing and doesn't support certificates for unique hostnames.
|Starting Point     | N/A
|Expected Outcome   | The host machine can resolve arbitrary DNS hostnames without impacting normal network connectivity
|Helpful Reading    | N/A
|Estimated Duration | 5 minutes
|=======================================================================================================================

Machines resolve DNS hostnames (e.g. `nifi.apache.org`) to IP addresses (`95.216.24.32`). Each node in a NiFi cluster needs a hostname (e.g. `node1.nificluster.com`) to use while serving the UI/API and to communicate with peer nodes. When deploying a cluster of multiple nodes on the same physical/virtual host, each node can receive a different, non-conflicting set of ports, but the hostname (`localhost`) would conflict. By allowing arbitrary hostname resolution, each node can reside side-by-side but be identified uniquely.

For this guide, any hostname which ends in `.nifi` will resolve to `localhost`.

Prerequisites:

* A *nix (or similar) operating system
* A package manager (e.g. `apt-get`, `yum`, `brew`). The instructions below use `brew`; substitute the command for the relevant package manager inline

The end result will resolve `*.nifi` hostnames to the local machine and all other names with the pre-existing DNS resolution services.

. Install and configure dnsmasq.
.. Install dnsmasq.
* `brew install dnsmasq`

.. Create a new file `nifi` in `/etc/resolver/`. This filename must match the top-level domain (TLD) to be resolved (e.g. `hostname.nifi` -> `nifi`, `hostname.example` -> `example`).
* `sudo $EDITOR /etc/resolver/nifi`

.. Populate the `nifi` file and register a new DNS resolver (`dnsmasq` running on this host) with the OS.
* Add the following line to `nifi`:

--
[source]
----
nameserver 127.0.0.1
----
--

.. Restart `dnsmasq`:
* `sudo brew services restart dnsmasq`

. To test successful deployment of the new DNS resolver, ping two addresses. One is an external site not hosted by this machine to demonstrate that regular DNS functionality remains, and the other is a new hostname which this machine will respond to.
... Ping an existing website hosted externally (https://nifi.apache.org).
* `ping -c 1 nifi.apache.org`

Here the `nifi.apache.org` resolution is done by the system's default DNS resolver and resolves to `95.216.24.32` (not this machine).

Here the `*.nifi` resolution redirects to the host machine's IP (`127.0.0.1`) which was configured via the  `/etc/resolver/nifi` file.

=== Securing NiFi with mTLS

NOTE: link:https://lists.apache.org/thread/vn1nzobtz4fh7fs461sgg8jj9zygrk0f[(recent mailing list discussion)^]

A secure setup of a NiFi cluster involves a set of keystores and truststores to facilitate secure communication between cluster nodes via the mTLS protocol.  Each cluster node will use a keystore containing a private key and certificate used to identify itself, and a truststore with a certificate that specifies trusted remote endpoints.  Commonly, the truststore will specify a single certificate authority, which can enable a trust relationship with any certificate signed by the authority.

Multiple options are available to create the needed keystores and truststores:

* kubernetes / cert-manager link:https://cert-manager.io/[(link)^]
* Let's Encrypt link:https://letsencrypt.org/[(link)^]
* organization-specific Certificate Authorities
* mkcert link:https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert/[(link)^]

In the special case of a single node NiFi development instance, automatic self-signed certificate generation has been available in NiFi since version 1.14.0.  This utility performs the needed certificate generation and configuration on the first run of a freshly built NiFi assembly.

==== Manual Keystore Generation
Manual use of link:https://www.openssl.org/[openssl^] and/or the Java `keytool` utility can also help to provide the keystores and truststores to secure NiFi cluster communications.  While use of one of the previously mentioned alternatives is encouraged, these commands are documented for informational purposes, and as an additional alternative if needed.

NOTE: The following OpenSSL version is known to support generation of certificates with "subjectAltName": `OpenSSL 3.0.7 1 Nov 2022`.  The following OpenSSL version is known not to support generation of certificates with "subjectAltName": `LibreSSL 2.8.3`.

NOTE: In the below instructions, values for `subjectAltName IP` and `subjectAltName DNS` should be substituted as appropriate for the use case.  The instructions intend only to convey syntax.

NOTE: Many of the below commands will request a password that will protect the data generated by the command.  Choose a password appropriately strong for the use case.  Protect the security of the passwords and generated files in a manner appropriate for the use case.

. Generate certificate authority key.
- `openssl genrsa -aes256 -out ca.key 3072`

. Generate cluster node key (one for each node).
- `openssl genrsa -aes256 -out nifi1.key 3072`
- `openssl genrsa -aes256 -out nifi2.key 3072`
- ...

. Generate certificate authority certificate.
- `openssl req -new -x509 -days 1461 -key ca.key -sha256  -out ca.cer -subj "/CN=nifi-ca/OU=nifi/"`

. Generate cluster node certificate signing request (one for each node).
- `openssl req -new -key nifi1.key -out nifi1.csr -subj "/CN=nifi1/OU=nifi/" -addext "subjectAltName = IP:192.168.1.1,DNS:localhost"`
- `openssl req -new -key nifi2.key -out nifi2.csr -subj "/CN=nifi2/OU=nifi/" -addext "subjectAltName = IP:192.168.1.2,DNS:localhost"`
- ...

. Generate cluster node certificate, using certificate authority key (one for each node).
- `openssl x509 -req -in nifi1.csr -CA ca.cer -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out nifi1.cer -days 365 -sha256 -copy_extensions=copyall`
- `openssl x509 -req -in nifi2.csr -CA ca.cer -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out nifi1.cer -days 365 -sha256 -copy_extensions=copyall`
- ...

. Generate cluster node certificate chain (one for each node).
- `cat nifi1.cer ca.cer >nifi1.chain.cer`
- `cat nifi2.cer ca.cer >nifi2.chain.cer`
- ...

. Generate certificate authority keystore.
- `keytool -importcert -keystore trust.p12 -storetype PKCS12 -file ca.cer -alias 1`

. Generate cluster node keystore (one for each node).
- `openssl pkcs12 -export -out nifi1.p12 -inkey nifi1.key -in nifi1.chain.cer`
- `openssl pkcs12 -export -out nifi2.p12 -inkey nifi2.key -in nifi2.chain.cer`
- ...

After completing these steps, use the generated keystores and truststore as follows:
[options="header"]
|======================
|Node  |Keystore  |Truststore
|nifi1 |nifi1.p12 |trust.p12
|nifi2 |nifi2.p12 |trust.p12
|...   |...       |trust.p12
|======================
