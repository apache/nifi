[[overview]]
== Overview
All data in Apache NiFi is represented by an abstraction called a FlowFile.
A FlowFile is comprised of two major pieces: content and attributes.
The content portion of the FlowFile represents the data on which to operate.
For instance, if a file is picked up from a local file system using the
GetFile Processor, the contents of the file will become the contents of the
FlowFile.

The attributes portion of the FlowFile represents information about the data
itself, or metadata. Attributes are key-value pairs that represent what is
known about the data as well as information that is useful for routing and
processing the data appropriately.
Keeping with the example of a file that is picked up from
a local file system, the FlowFile would have an attribute called `filename` that
reflected the name of the file on the file system. Additionally, the FlowFile will
have a `path` attribute that reflects the directory on the file system that this
file lived in. The FlowFile will also have an attribute named `uuid`, which is a
unique identifier for this FlowFile. For complete listing of the core attributes
check out the FlowFile section of the link:developer-guide.html#flowfile[Developer's Guide].

However, placing these attributes on a FlowFile do not provide much benefit
if the user is unable to make use of them. The NiFi Expression Language provides
the ability to reference these attributes, compare them to other values,
and manipulate their values.


[[structure]]
== Structure of a NiFi Expression

The NiFi Expression Language always begins with the start delimiter `${` and ends
with the end delimiter `}`. Between the start and end delimiters is the text of the
Expression itself. In its most basic form, the Expression can consist of just an
attribute name. For example, `${filename}` will return the value of the `filename`
attribute.

In a slightly more complex example, we can instead return a manipulation of this value.
We can, for example, return an all upper-case version of the filename by calling the
`toUpper` function: `${filename:toUpper()}`. In this case, we reference the `filename`
attribute and then manipulate this value by using the `toUpper` function. A function call
consists of 5 elements. First, there is a function call delimiter `:`. Second is the name
of the function - in this case, `toUpper`. Next is an open parenthesis (`(`), followed
by the function arguments. The arguments necessary are dependent upon which function
is being called. In this example, we are using the `toUpper` function, which does not
have any arguments, so this element is omitted. Finally, the closing parenthesis (`)`)
indicates the end of the function call. There are many different functions that are supported
by the Expression Language to achieve many different goals. Some functions provide String (text)
manipulation, such as the `toUpper` function. Others, such as the `equals` and `matches` functions,
provide comparison functionality. Functions also exist for manipulating dates and times and
for performing mathematical operations. Each of these functions is described below, in the
<<functions>> section, with an explanation of what the function does, the arguments that it
requires, and the type of information that it returns.

When we perform a function call on an attribute, as above, we refer to the attribute as the
_subject_ of the function, as the attribute is the entity on which the function is operating.
We can then chain together multiple function calls, where the return value of the first function
becomes the subject of the second function and its return value becomes the subject of the third
function and so on. Continuing with our example, we can chain together multiple functions by using
the expression `${filename:toUpper():equals('HELLO.TXT')}`. There is no limit to the number of
functions that can be chained together.

Any FlowFile attribute can be referenced using the Expression Language. However, if the attribute
name contains a "special character", the attribute name must be escaped by quoting it. The following
characters are each considered "special characters":

- $ (dollar sign)
- | (pipe)
- { (open brace)
- } (close brace)
- ( (open parenthesis)
- ) (close parenthesis)
- [ (open bracket)
- ] (close bracket)
- , (comma)
- : (colon)
- ; (semicolon)
- / (forward slash)
- * (asterisk)
- ' (single quote)
-  (space)
- \t (tab)
- \r (carriage return)
- \n (new-line)

Additionally, a number is considered a "special character" if it is the first character of the attribute name.
If any of these special characters is present in an attribute is quoted by using either single or double quotes.
The Expression Language allows single quotes and double quotes to be used interchangeably. For example, the following
can be used to escape an attribute named `my attribute`: `${"my attribute"}` or `${'my attribute'}`.

In this example, the value to be returned is the value of the "my attribute" value, if it exists. If that attribute
does not exist, the Expression Language will then look for a System Environment Variable named "my attribute." If
unable to find this, it will look for a JVM System Property named "my attribute." Finally, if none of these exists,
the Expression Language will return a `null` value.

There also exist some functions that expect to have no subject. These functions are invoked simply
by calling the function at the beginning of the Expression, such as `${hostname()}`. These functions
can then be changed together, as well. For example, `${hostname():toUpper()}`. Attempting to
evaluate the function with subject will result in an error. In the <<functions>>
section below, these functions will clearly indicate in their descriptions that they do not
require a subject.

Often times, we will need to compare the values of two different attributes to each other.
We are able to accomplish this by using embedded Expressions. We can, for example, check if
the `filename` attribute is the same as the `uuid` attribute: `${filename:equals( ${uuid} )}`.
Notice here, also, that we have a space between the opening parenthesis for the `equals` method and
the embedded Expression. This is not necessary and does not affect how the Expression is evaluated
in any way. Rather, it is intended to make the Expression easier to read. White space is ignored by
the Expression Language between delimiters. Therefore, we can use the Expression
`${     filename   : equals(${    uuid})  }` or `${filename:equals(${uuid})}` and both Expressions
mean the same thing. We cannot, however, use `${file name:equals(${uuid})}`, because this results
in `file` and `name` being interpreted as different tokens, rather than a single token, `filename`.



[[usage]]
== Expression Language in the Application

The Expression Language is used heavily throughout the NiFi application for configuring Processor
properties. Not all Processor properties support the Expression Language, however. Whether or not
a Property supports the Expression Language is determined by the developer of the Processor when
the Processor is written. However, the application strives to clearly illustrate for each Property
whether or not the Expression Language is supported.

In the application, when configuring a component property, the User Interface provides an Information
icon (
image:iconInfo.png["Info"]
) next to the name of the Property. Hovering over this icon with the mouse will provide a tooltip that
provides helpful information about the Property. This information includes a description of the Property,
the default value (if any), historically configured values (if any), and the evaluation scope of this
property for expression language. There are three values and the evaluation scope of the expression
language is hierarchical: NONE -> VARIABLE_REGISTRY -> FLOWFILE_ATTRIBUTES.

* NONE - expression language is not supported for this property
* VARIABLE_REGISTRY is hierarchically constructed as below:
** Variables defined at process group level and then, recursively, up to the higher process group until
the root process group.
** Variables defined in custom properties files through the nifi.variable.registry.properties property
in nifi.properties file.
** Environment variables defined at JVM level and system properties.
* FLOWFILE_ATTRIBUTES - will use attributes of each individual flow file, as well as those variables defined
by the Variable Registry, as described above.

[[escaping]]
=== Escaping Expression Language
:extra-dollar-sign: Hello $${UserName}
:literal-value: Hello $$User$$Name
:four-dollar-signs: $$$${abc}
:five-dollar-signs: $$$$${abc}

There may be times when a property supports Expression Language, but the user wishes to use a literal value
that follows the same syntax as the Expression Language. For example, a user may want to configure a property
value to be the literal text `Hello ${UserName}`. In such a case, this can be accomplished by using an extra
`$` (dollar sign symbol) just before the expression to escape it (i.e., `{extra-dollar-sign}`). Unless the `$`
character is being used to escape an Expression, it should not be escaped. For example, the value `{literal-value}`
should not escape the `$` characters, so the literal value that will be used is `{literal-value}`.

If more than two `$` characters are encountered sequentially before a `{`, then each pair of `$` characters will
be considered an escaping of the `$` character. The escaping will be performed from left-to-right.
To help illustrate this, consider that the variable `abc` contains the value `xyz`. Then, consider the following
table of Expressions and their corresponding evaluated values:

.Escaping EL Examples
|========================================================================================
| Expression | Value | Notes
| `${abc}` | `xyz` |
| `$${abc}` | `${abc}` |
| `$$${abc}` | `$xyz` |
| `{four-dollar-signs}` | `$${abc}` |
| `{five-dollar-signs}` | `$$xyz` |
| `I owe you $5` | `I owe you $5` | No actual Expression is present here.
| `You owe me $$5 too` | `You owe me $$5 too` | The $ character is not escaped because it does not immediately precede an Expression.
| `Unescaped $$${5 because no closing brace` | `Unescaped $$${5 because no closing brace` | Because there is no closing brace here, there is no actual Expression and hence the $ characters are not
escaped.
| `Unescaped $$${5} because no closing brace` | <Error> | This expression is not valid because it equates to an escaped $, followed by `${5}` and the `${5}` is not a valid Expression. The number
must be escaped.
| `Unescaped $$${'5'} because no closing brace` | `Unescaped $ because no closing brace` | There is no attribute named `5` so the Expression evaluates to an empty string. The `$$` evaluates to a
single (escaped) `$` because it immediately precedes an Expression.
|========================================================================================

[[editor]]
=== Expression Language Editor

When configuring the value of a Processor property, the NiFi User Interface provides help with the
Expression Language using the Expression Language editor. Once an Expression is begin by typing `${`,
the editor begins to highlight parentheses and braces so that the user is easily able to tell which
opening parenthesis or brace matches which closing parenthesis or brace.

The editor also supplies context-sensitive help by providing a list of all functions that can be used
at the current cursor position. To activate this feature, press Ctrl+Space on the keyboard. The user
is also able to type part of a function name and then press Ctrl+Space to see all functions that can
be used that start with the same prefix. For example, if we type into the editor `${filename:to`
and then press Ctrl+Space, we are provided a pop-up that lists six different functions: `toDate`,
`toLower`, `toNumber`, `toRadix`, `toString`, and `toUpper`. We can then continue typing to narrow
which functions are shown, or we can select one of the functions from the list by double-clicking
it with the mouse or using the arrow keys to highlight the desired function and pressing Enter.



[[functions]]
== Functions

Functions provide a convenient way to manipulate and compare values of attributes. The Expression Language
provides many different functions to meet the needs of a automated dataflow. Each function takes
zero or more arguments and returns a single value. These functions can then be chained together to create
powerful Expressions to evaluate conditions and manipulate values. See <<structure>> for more information
on how to call and chain functions together.

[[types]]
=== Data Types

Each argument to a function and each value returned from a function has a specific data type. The Expression
Language supports four different data types:

- *String*: A String is a sequence of characters that can consist of numbers, letters, white space, and
	special characters.
- *Number*: A Number is an whole number comprised of one or more digits (`0` through `9`). When converting to numbers from Date data types, they are represented as
	the number of milliseconds since midnight GMT on January 1, 1970.
- *Decimal*: A Decimal is a numeric value that can support decimals and larger values with minimal loss of precision. More precisely it
    is a double-precision 64-bit IEEE 754 floating point. Due to this minimal loss of precision this data type should not be used for
    very precise values, such as currency. For more documentation on the range of values stored in this data type
    refer to this link:https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-4.html#jls-4.2.3[link^]. The following are some examples of the forms of
    literal decimals that are supported in expression language (the "E" can also be lower-case):

        * 1.1
        * .1E1
        * 1.11E-12

- *Date*: A Date is an object that holds a Date and Time. Utilizing the <<dates>> and <<type_cast>> functions this data
	type can be converted to/from Strings and numbers. If the whole Expression Language expression is evaluated to be a
	date then it will be converted to a String with the format: "<Day of Week> <Month> <Day of Month> <Hour>:<Minute>:<Second> <Time Zone> <Year>".
	Also expressed as "E MMM dd HH:mm:ss z yyyy" in Java SimpleDateFormat format. For example: "Wed Dec 31 12:00:04 UTC 2016".
- *Boolean*: A Boolean is one of either `true` or `false`.

After evaluating expression language functions, all attributes are stored as type String.

The Expression Language is generally able to automatically coerce a value of one data type to the appropriate
data type for a function. However, functions do exist to manually coerce a value into a specific data type.
See the <<type_cast>> section for more information.

Hex values are supported for Number and Decimal types but they must be quoted and prepended with "0x" when being
interpreted as literals. For example these two expressions are valid (without the quotes or "0x" the expression would fail to run properly):

 - ${literal("0xF"):toNumber()}
 - ${literal("0xF.Fp10"):toDecimal()}




[[boolean]]
== Boolean Logic

One of the most powerful features of the Expression Language is the ability to compare an attribute value against
some other value. This is used often, for example, to configure how a Processor should route data. The following
functions are used for performing boolean logic, such as comparing two values.
Each of these functions are designed to work on values of type Boolean.


[.function]
=== isNull

If a decimal is passed as the subject, it will first be converted to a whole number and then processed.#

*Subject Type*: [.subject]#Number#

*Arguments*:

	- [.argName]#_Desired Base_# : [.argDesc]#A Number between 2 and 36 (inclusive)#
	- [.argName]#_Padding_# : [.argDesc]#Optional argument that specifies the minimum number of characters in the converted output#

*Return Type*: [.returnType]#String#

*Examples*: If the "fileSize" attributes has a value of 1024, then the following Expressions will yield
	the following results:


.toRadix Examples
|=======================================================================================
| Expression | Value
| `${fileSize:toRadix(10)}` | `1024`
| `${fileSize:toRadix(10, 1)}` | `1024`
| `${fileSize:toRadix(10, 8)}` | `00001024`
| `${fileSize:toRadix(16)}` | `400`
| `${fileSize:toRadix(16, 8)}` | `00000400`
| `${fileSize:toRadix(2)}` | `10000000000`

[.function]
=== fromRadix

*Description*: [.description]#Converts the Subject from a specified Radix (or number base) to a base ten whole number. The subject will converted as is, without interpretation, and all characters must be valid for the base being converted from. For example converting "0xFF" from hex will not work due to "x" being a invalid hex character. If a decimal is passed as the subject, it will first be converted to a whole number and then processed.#

*Subject Type*: [.subject]#String#

*Arguments*:

	- [.argName]#_Subject Base_# : [.argDesc]#A Number between 2 and 36 (inclusive)#

*Return Type*: [.returnType]#Number#

*Examples*: If the "fileSize" attributes has a value of 1234A, then the following Expressions will yield
	the following results:


.toRadix Examples
|=======================================================================================
| Expression | Value
| `${fileSize:fromRadix(11)}` | `17720`
| `${fileSize:fromRadix(16)}` | `74570`
| `${fileSize:fromRadix(20)}` | `177290`

[.function]
=== random

*Description*: [.description]#Returns a random whole number ( 0 to 2^63 - 1) using an insecure random number generator.#

*Subject Type*: [.subjectless]#No subject#

*Arguments*: No arguments

*Return Type*: [.returnType]#Number#

*Examples*: `${random():mod(10):plus(1)}` returns random number between 1 and 10 inclusive.

[.function]
=== math

*Description*: [.description]#ADVANCED FEATURE. This expression is designed to be used by advanced users only. It utilizes Java Reflection to run arbitrary java.lang.Math static methods. The exact API will depend on the version of Java you are running. The Java 8 API can be found here: link:https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html[https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html^]
 +
In order to run the correct method, the parameter types must be correct. The Expression Language "Number" (whole number) type is interpreted as a Java "long". The "Decimal" type is interpreted as a Java "double". Running the desired method may require calling "toNumber()" or "toDecimal()" in order to "cast" the value to the desired type. This also is important to remember when cascading "math()" calls since the return type depends on the method that was run.#

*Subject Type*: [.subject .subjectless]#Subjectless, Number or Decimal (depending on the desired method to run)#

*Arguments*:

	- [.argName]#_Method_# : [.argDesc]#The name of the Java Math method to run#
	- [.argName]#_Optional Argument_# : [.argDesc]#Optional argument that acts as the second parameter to the method.#

*Return Type*: [.returnType]#Number or Decimal (depending on method run)#

*Examples*:

	- ${math("random")} runs Math.random().

	- ${literal(2):toDecimal:math("pow", 2.5)} runs Math.pow(2D,2.5D).

	- ${literal(64):toDouble():math("cbrt"):toNumber():math("max", 5)} runs Math.max((Double.valueOf(Math.cbrt(64D))).longValue(), 5L). Note that the toDecimal() is needed because "cbrt" takes a "double" as input and the "64" will get interpreted as a long. The "toDecimal()" call is necessary to correctly call the method. that the "toNumber()" call is necessary because "cbrt" returns a double and the "max" method is must have parameters of the same type and "5" is interpreted as a long.

	- ${literal(5.4):math("scalb", 2)} runs Math.scalb(5.4, 2). This example is important because NiFi EL treats all whole numbers as "longs" and there is no concept of an "int". "scalb" takes a second parameter of an "int" and it is not overloaded to accept longs so it could not be run without special type handling. In the instance where the Java method cannot be found using parameters of type "double" and "long" the "math()" EL function will attempt to find a Java method with the same name but parameters of "double" and "int".

	- ${first:toDecimal():math("pow", ${second:toDecimal()})} where attributes evaluate to "first" = 2.5 and "second" = 2. This example runs Math.pow(2.5D, 2D). The explicit calls to toDecimal() are important because of the dynamic nature of EL. When creating the flow, the user is unaware if the expression language values will be able to be interpreted as a whole number or not. In this example without the explicit calls "toDecimal" the "math" function would attempt to run a Java method "pow" with types "double" and "long" (which doesn't exist).

[[dates]]
== Date Manipulation



[[format]]
[.function]
=== format

*Description*: [.description]#Formats a number as a date/time according to the format specified by the argument. The argument
	must be a String that is a valid Java SimpleDateFormat format. The Subject is expected to be a Number that
	represents the number of milliseconds since Midnight GMT on January 1, 1970. The number will be evaluated using the local
	time zone unless specified in the second optional argument.#

*Subject Type*: [.subject]#Number#

*Arguments*:

	- [.argName]#_format_# : [.argDesc]#The format to use in the Java SimpleDateFormat syntax#
	- [.argName]#_time zone_# : [.argDesc]#Optional argument that specifies the time zone to use (in the Java TimeZone syntax)#

*Return Type*: [.returnType]#String#

*Examples*: If the attribute "time" has the value "1420058163264", then the following Expressions will yield
	the following results:

.format Examples
|============================================================================
| Expression | Value
| `${time:format("yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss.SSS\'Z'", "GMT")}` | `2014/12/31 20:36:03.264Z`
| `${time:format("yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss.SSS\'Z'", "America/Los_Angeles")}` | `2014/12/31 12:36:03.264Z`
| `${time:format("yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss.SSS\'Z'", "Asia/Tokyo")}` | `2015/01/01 05:36:03.264Z`
| `${time:format("yyyy/MM/dd", "GMT")}` | `2014/12/31`
| `${time:format("HH:mm:ss.SSS\'Z'", "GMT")}` | `20:36:03.264Z`
| `${time:format("yyyy", "GMT")}` | `2014`
|============================================================================





[.function]
=== toDate

*Description*: [.description]#Converts a String into a Date data type, based on the format specified by the argument. The argument
	must be a String that is a valid Java SimpleDateFormat syntax. The Subject is expected to be a String that is formatted
	according the argument. The date will be evaluated using the local time zone unless specified in the second optional argument.#

*Subject Type*: [.subject]#String#

*Arguments*:

		- [.argName]#_format_# : [.argDesc]#The current format to use when parsing the Subject, in the Java SimpleDateFormat syntax.#
		- [.argName]#_time zone_# : [.argDesc]#Optional argument that specifies the time zone to use when parsing the Subject, in the Java TimeZone syntax.#


*Return Type*: [.returnType]#Date#

*Examples*: If the attribute "year" has the value "2014" and the attribute "time" has the value "2014/12/31 15:36:03.264Z",
	then the Expression `${year:toDate('yyyy', 'GMT')}` will return a Date data type with a value representing Midnight GMT on
	January 1, 2014. The Expression `${time:toDate("yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss.SSS'Z'", "GMT")}` will result in a Date data type for
	15:36:03.264 GMT on December 31, 2014.

Often, this function is used in conjunction with the <<format>> function to change the format of a date/time. For example,
if the attribute "date" has the value "12-24-2014" and we want to change the format to "2014/12/24", we can do so by
chaining together the two functions: `${date:toDate('MM-dd-yyyy'):format('yyyy/MM/dd')}`.




[.function]
=== now

*Description*: [.description]#Returns the current date and time as a Date data type object.#

*Subject Type*: [.subjectless]#No Subject#

*Arguments*: No arguments

*Return Type*: [.returnType]#Date#

*Examples*: We can get the current date and time as a Date data type by using the `now` function: `${now()}`. As an example,
	on Wednesday December 31st 2014 at 36 minutes after 3pm and 36.123 seconds EST `${now()}` would be evaluated to be a
	Date type representing that time. Since whole Expression Language expressions can only return Strings it would formatted as
	`Wed Dec 31 15:36:03 EST 2014` when the expression completes.

Utilizing the <<toNumber>> method, `now` can provide the current date and time as the number of milliseconds since
Midnight GMT on January 1, 1970. For instance, if instead of executing `${now()}` in the previous example `${now():toNumber()}`
was run then it would output `1453843201123`. This method provides millisecond-level precision and provides the ability to
manipulate the value.

.now Examples
|==================================================================================================================
| Expression | Value
| `${now()}` | A Date type representing the current date and time to the nearest millisecond
| `${now():toNumber()}` | The number of milliseconds since midnight GMT Jan 1, 1970 (`1453843201123`, for example)
| `${now():toNumber():minus(86400000)` | A number presenting the time 24 hours ago
| `${now():format('yyyy')}` | The current year
| `${now():toNumber():minus(86400000):format('E')}` | The day of the week that was yesterday,
													  as a 3-letter abbreviation (For example, `Wed`)
|==================================================================================================================

[[subjectless]]
== Subjectless Functions

While the majority of functions in the Expression Language are called by using the syntax
`${attributeName:function()}`, there exist a few functions that are not expected to have subjects.
In this case, the attribute name is not present. For example, the IP address of the machine can
be obtained by using the Expression `${ip()}`. All of the functions in this section are to be called
without a subject. Attempting to call a subjectless function and provide it a subject will result in
an error when validating the function.


[.function]
=== ip

*Description*: [.description]#Returns the IP address of the machine.#

*Subject Type*: [.subjectless]#No subject#

*Arguments*: No arguments

*Return Type*: [.returnType]#String#

*Examples*: The IP address of the machine can be obtained by using the Expression `${ip()}`.





[.function]
=== hostname

*Description*: [.description]#Returns the Hostname of the machine. An optional argument of type Boolean can be provided
	to specify whether or not the Fully Qualified Domain Name should be used. If `false`, or not specified,
	the hostname will not be fully qualified. If the argument is `true` but the fully qualified hostname
	cannot be resolved, the simple hostname will be returned.#

*Subject Type*: [.subjectless]#No subject#

*Arguments*:

	- [.argName]#_Fully Qualified_# : [.argDesc]#Optional parameter that specifies whether or not the hostname should be
		fully qualified. If not specified, defaults to false.#

*Return Type*: [.returnType]#String#

*Examples*: The fully qualified hostname of the machine can be obtained by using the Expression `${hostname(true)}`,
	while the simple hostname can be obtained by using either `${hostname(false)}` or simply `${hostname()}`.





[.function]
=== UUID

*Description*: [.description]#Returns a randomly generated UUID.#

*Subject Type*: [.subjectless]#No Subject#

*Arguments*: No arguments

*Return Type*: [.returnType]#String#

*Examples*: ${UUID()} returns a value similar to de305d54-75b4-431b-adb2-eb6b9e546013





[.function]
=== nextInt

*Description*: [.description]#Returns a one-up value (starting at 0) and increasing over the lifetime of the running instance of NiFi.
	This value is not persisted across restarts and is not guaranteed to be unique across a cluster.
	This value is considered "one-up" in that if called multiple times across the NiFi instance, the values will be sequential.
	However, this counter is shared across all NiFi components, so calling this function multiple times from one Processor will
	not guarantee sequential values within the context of a particular Processor.#

*Subject Type*: [.subjectless]#No Subject#

*Arguments*: No arguments

*Return Type*: [.returnType]#Number#

*Examples*: If the previous value returned by `nextInt` was `5`, the Expression `${nextInt():divide(2)}` obtains the next available
	integer (6) and divides the result by 2, returning a value of `3`.



[.function]
=== literal

*Description*: [.description]#Returns its argument as a literal String value. This is useful in order to treat a string or a number
	at the beginning of an Expression as an actual value, rather than treating it as an attribute name. Additionally, it
	can be used when the argument is an embedded Expression that we would then like to evaluate additional functions against.#

*Subject Type*: [.subjectless]#No Subject#

*Arguments*:

	- [.argName]#_value_# : [.argDesc]#The value to be treated as a literal string, number, or boolean value.#

*Return Type*: [.returnType]#String#

*Examples*: `${literal(2):gt(1)}` returns `true`

`${literal( ${allMatchingAttributes('a.*'):count()} ):gt(3)}` returns true if there are more than 3 attributes whose
names begin with the letter `a`.

[.function]
=== getStateValue

*Description*: [.description]#Access a processor's state values by passing in the String key and getting the value back as a String. This
 is a special Expression Language function that only works with processors that explicitly allow EL to query state. Currently only UpdateAttribute
 does.#

*Subject Type*: [.subjectless]#No Subject#

*Arguments*:

	- [.String]#_Key_# : [.argDesc]#The key to use when accessing the state map.#

*Return Type*: [.returnType]#String#

*Examples*: UpdateAttribute processor has stored the key "count" with value "20" in state. '${getStateValue("count")}` returns `20`.

[[multi]]
== Evaluating Multiple Attributes

When it becomes necessary to evaluate the same conditions against multiple attributes, this can be accomplished by means of the
`and` and `or` functions. However, this quickly becomes tedious, error-prone, and difficult to maintain. For this reason, NiFi
provides several functions for evaluating the same conditions against groups of attributes at the same time.




[.function]
=== anyAttribute

*Description*: [.description]#Checks to see if any of the given attributes, match the given condition. This function has no subject and takes one or more
